# SupaSnake AAA - Vision Statement
## The Genetic Empire That Fits In Your Pocket

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Status:** NORTH STAR DOCUMENT - Guides All Strategic Decisions

---

## Vision (One Sentence)

**SupaSnake is the first mobile game where Snake is not the game - it's the resource collection mechanic for building an infinite genetic empire, combining Marvel SNAP's quick-session strategy with Supercell's fair-gacha collection in a uniquely addictive meta-loop.**

---

## Elevator Pitch (30 Seconds)

"Remember Snake? The Nokia classic? We've transformed it into something nobody's seen before.

SupaSnake is a genetic empire builder disguised as Snake. You're not chasing high scores - you're mining DNA to breed, evolve, and collect 500+ unique snake variants across dynasties like CYBER, PRIMAL, and COSMIC. Every 5-minute run feeds an infinite progression engine. 70% of playtime is in the Lab, breeding specimens and completing collection sets. 30% is Snake - but it's the most satisfying Snake you've ever played.

Think Marvel SNAP's 3-minute matches meets Clash Royale's collection depth, with Snake as the hook. No pay-to-win, just pay-to-accelerate. Fair gacha, generous F2P economy, Supercell-grade polish.

We're launching v0.1 in 3 months with AI-assisted development. Year 1 target: 1M MAU, $2M ARR. We're building the next generation of mobile collection games."

---

## The Paradigm Shift

### What Players Think They're Getting
A premium Snake game with some collection features.

### What They Actually Discover (In 5 Minutes)
A genetic empire builder where Snake runs are just resource mining. The real game is the infinite progression of breeding generations, completing dynasty collections, and showcasing rare specimens.

### The Moment of Realization
**Minute 3:** "This Snake feels amazing - 60fps, perfect controls."
**Minute 5:** "Wait... the Lab is where I spend my DNA? I can breed snakes?"
**Minute 15:** "I'm not playing Snake anymore. I'm building a collection empire."
**Day 7:** "I'm a CYBER dynasty specialist with Gen 8 rare variants."
**Day 30:** "How did I spend 20 hours in the Lab vs 8 hours actually playing Snake?"

---

## Design Pillars

### Pillar 1: Snake is Sacred
**What it means:** The core Snake gameplay must be the best mobile Snake experience ever created. 60fps, instant responsiveness, satisfying feedback, AAA polish from second one.

**Why it matters:** Snake is the trust signal. Players must immediately feel "this is premium" or they'll never discover the meta-game. If Snake feels cheap, they'll never reach the Lab.

**Non-negotiable:**
- 60fps on mid-range devices (iPhone 12, Galaxy S21)
- <50ms input latency
- Satisfying audio/visual feedback for every action
- Polished, modern aesthetic (not retro pixel art)
- First win achievable in <60 seconds

**Validation:**
- Can a 10-year-old play and immediately understand?
- Would a hardcore Snake player respect the controls?
- Does it feel better than every Snake game on the App Store?

---

### Pillar 2: The Lab is the Game
**What it means:** 70% of session time must occur in the Snake Lab. The meta-game is not a side feature - it's the primary engagement loop. Snake runs are the means to an end.

**Why it matters:** This is the paradigm shift. If players spend equal time in Snake vs Lab, we've failed. The Lab must be so compelling that Snake becomes a strategic choice (when to mine resources) rather than the core activity.

**Non-negotiable:**
- Lab discovery within 5 minutes of first session
- Every Snake run followed by Lab activity (spend DNA, check breeding)
- Lab has more depth than Snake (more systems, more decisions, more progression)
- Lab progression visible and rewarding (dopamine hits every session)
- Social showcase happens in Lab (not Snake leaderboards)

**Validation:**
- Telemetry: Lab time / Total time >= 0.70
- Survey: "What's your favorite part?" → "Breeding" > "Playing Snake"
- Retention: Players who engage with Lab have 3x D7 retention

---

### Pillar 3: Infinite Progression, Zero Ceiling
**What it means:** There is no "endgame." Snake generations can reach Gen 100+. New dynasties launch monthly. Collection expands forever. Prestige systems reset for permanent bonuses. Mastery tracks have 200+ levels. Players always have a next goal.

**Why it matters:** Hard caps kill long-term retention. SNAP has limited cards (fixed meta). Clash has max levels (progression ends). SupaSnake's infinite engine keeps players engaged for years, not months.

**Non-negotiable:**
- Generation system: Gen 1 → Gen 2 → Gen 3 → Gen ∞ (no maximum)
- Monthly content: +1 new dynasty every month (Year 1 = 15+ dynasties)
- Collection targets that expand (complete CYBER → unlock CELESTIAL)
- No "you beat the game" moment - ever
- Prestige available at any generation (not locked behind max)

**Validation:**
- Can a player reach Gen 50? Yes (expensive but possible)
- Is there new content monthly? Yes (dynasty drops)
- Do Day 365 players have goals? Yes (new collections, prestige bonuses)

---

### Pillar 4: Fair Gacha, Generous F2P
**What it means:** Supercell monetization model. Pay for convenience (time-savers, energy bundles), not power (exclusive dynasties, better stats). F2P players can achieve everything payers can - just slower. No loot boxes with predatory odds. Transparent rates. Generous daily rewards.

**Why it matters:** Player trust and community health. Pay-to-win creates toxic communities and accelerates churn. Fair monetization builds 10-year franchises (Clash, Brawl Stars). We optimize for LTV, not ARPDAU.

**Non-negotiable:**
- Every dynasty unlockable via free play (no premium-exclusive)
- Paying saves time (energy bundles, breeding accelerators) but doesn't grant power
- No forced ads (all opt-in for bonus rewards)
- Starter bundle appears Day 3+ (not during tutorial)
- Published gacha rates (dynasty pulls, evolution chances)
- Daily free energy refill (no ads required)

**Validation:**
- Can F2P player complete CYBER dynasty? Yes (2-3 weeks)
- Does payer get unique Gen 10 snake? No (just got there faster)
- Are ads required for progression? No (purely opt-in bonuses)
- Survey: "Is SupaSnake pay-to-win?" → <10% say yes

---

### Pillar 5: Marvel SNAP Sessions, Clash Royale Depth
**What it means:** Individual Snake runs last 3-8 minutes (SNAP speed), but meta-game has hundreds of hours of depth (Clash longevity). Quick sessions fit into any schedule. Deep progression rewards long-term commitment.

**Why it matters:** Modern mobile players have fragmented attention. SNAP wins on accessibility (3 minutes anywhere). Clash wins on depth (years of content). SupaSnake combines both - quick runs feed infinite meta.

**Non-negotiable:**
- Classic Mode: 5-minute sessions (predictable time commitment)
- Tower Mode: 15-45 minute challenges (optional deep dives)
- Lab-only sessions: 10-20 minutes (breeding, collection browsing)
- Energy system creates 3+ sessions per day (natural pacing)
- 15+ minute average session length (meaningful engagement)

**Validation:**
- Can I play during a coffee break? Yes (5-min Classic run + Lab check)
- Can I play for an hour? Yes (Tower challenge + breeding marathon)
- Do I return 3+ times daily? Yes (energy recharges, breeding timers)

## Competitive Positioning

### vs. Marvel SNAP: How We Win

**SNAP's Strengths:**
- 3-minute matches (perfect for mobile)
- Strategic depth (deck building, location combos)
- Marvel IP (built-in audience)
- Polished UX (Second Dinner pedigree)

**SNAP's Weaknesses:**
- Limited card pool (feels repetitive by Month 3)
- Fixed meta (no infinite progression)
- Expensive monetization (bundles feel pricey)
- No social layer (no clans, limited friend features)
- RNG frustration (bad draws = auto-lose)

**How SupaSnake Wins:**
- **Infinite content:** Monthly dynasty drops vs fixed card pool
- **Fair F2P:** Supercell model vs SNAP's aggressive bundles
- **Collection depth:** 500+ variants Year 1 vs SNAP's 200 cards
- **Meta-game:** Lab breeding/evolution vs pure deck building
- **Social:** Clans, trading in v0.5+ vs SNAP's solo play
- **Skill floor:** Snake is more accessible than SNAP's complex combos

**Target Conversion:** 30% of SNAP players try SupaSnake, 40% of those convert to regulars

**Positioning:** "SupaSnake is SNAP for collection lovers - same quick sessions, infinite progression, and you don't need to know Marvel lore."

---

### vs. Clash Royale: How We Differentiate

**Clash's Strengths:**
- Massive player base (10M+ DAU peak)
- Clan features (social engagement)
- Competitive scene (esports, tournaments)
- Long-term retention (players stick for years)

**Clash's Weaknesses:**
- Pay-to-win stigma (maxed cards = competitive advantage)
- Grind wall (mid-game progression slows to crawl)
- PvP frustration (bad matchmaking, tilt)
- Over-monetized (constant purchase prompts)
- Stale meta (same decks for months)

**How SupaSnake Differentiates:**
- **No pay-to-win:** Stats equal for F2P and payers
- **PvE focus:** No PvP frustration (your pace, your progress)
- **Fair monetization:** Supercell's good practices without the predatory tactics
- **Nostalgia hook:** Snake is universally loved, not fantasy combat
- **Simpler core:** Snake is easier to learn than Clash mechanics

**Target Conversion:** 20% of ex-Clash players looking for fair alternative

**Positioning:** "SupaSnake is the collection game Clash players wish Clash was - fair F2P, infinite progression, no pay-to-win."

---

### vs. Pokémon GO: How We Compete for Collection Players

**Pokémon GO's Strengths:**
- Pokémon IP (strongest gaming brand)
- AR integration (location-based gameplay)
- Social events (community days, raids)
- Collection completionism (gotta catch 'em all)

**Pokémon GO's Weaknesses:**
- Requires outdoor play (weather, safety, accessibility barriers)
- Grind-heavy (repetitive catching, limited engagement)
- Weak meta-game (battles are secondary)
- Monetization feels mercenary (raid passes, storage)
- No meaningful progression (catching is 90% of gameplay)

**How SupaSnake Competes:**
- **Play anywhere:** No location requirements (couch-friendly)
- **Deep meta-game:** Lab is 70% of gameplay vs GO's 10% battle system
- **Breeding depth:** Strategic genetics vs GO's static Pokémon
- **Fair monetization:** Supercell model vs GO's aggressive tactics
- **Infinite progression:** Generations 1 → ∞ vs GO's static collection

**Target Conversion:** 15% of collection-focused GO players

**Positioning:** "SupaSnake is Pokémon GO for people who want the collection depth without leaving their home."

---

### Market Gap: The Strategic Position

**What exists:**
- Quick sessions (SNAP, Clash)
- Collection games (Pokémon GO, Clash)
- Fair F2P (Brawl Stars, among few)

**What's missing:**
- Quick sessions + Collection depth + Fair F2P + Infinite progression

**SupaSnake fills the gap:**
- SNAP's accessibility + Clash's collection + Supercell's fairness + Infinite scaling
- Nostalgia IP (Snake) that's universally loved and unencumbered
- Meta-game as primary engagement (not PvP, not location-based)

**Blue Ocean Positioning:** "Genetic empire builder for the mobile-first generation"

---

**Player Pain Points:**
- SNAP players hitting content ceiling (fixed card pool)
- Clash refugees seeking fair monetization

## North Star Metrics

### The One Number That Matters

**D30 Retention Rate**

If D30 retention is 15%+, everything else follows:
- High retention = high LTV
- High LTV = sustainable CAC
- Sustainable CAC = scalable growth
- Scalable growth = valuable business

If D30 drops below 15%, something is fundamentally broken:
- Core loop isn't sticky
- Monetization is predatory
- Content isn't compelling
- Competition is winning

**All strategic decisions filter through:** "Does this improve D30 retention?"

---

### The Daily Dashboard

**Monday Morning Check:**
1. D1/D7/D30 retention (health check)
2. DAU (growth trajectory)
3. Session length (engagement depth)
4. Lab time ratio (meta-game success)
5. ARPU (monetization efficiency)

**Red Flags:**
- D1 < 50% → Onboarding broken
- D7 < 25% → Core loop not sticky
- D30 < 15% → Fundamental problem
- Session < 10min → Not enough depth
- Lab ratio < 60% → Snake overshadowing meta
- ARPU < $0.40 → Monetization too weak

**Green Lights:**
- All metrics at or above targets
- Week-over-week growth in DAU
- Positive app store reviews (4.5+ stars)
- Social sharing increasing (organic growth)

## Conclusion: The 10-Year Vision

**Year 1-3:** Establish SupaSnake as the premier mobile collection game. Beat SNAP on depth, beat Clash on fairness, beat Pokémon GO on accessibility.

**Year 4-6:** Expand franchise. PC/console versions. Esports ecosystem. Merchandise and media. SupaSnake becomes a household name.

**Year 7-10:** Multi-game franchise. SupaSnake Racing (Mario Kart meets Snake). SupaSnake Battles (auto-battler). SupaSnake MMO (persistent world).

**The Ultimate Goal:** When people think "mobile collection game," they think SupaSnake first. The way Clash defined tower defense. The way SNAP defined quick-session strategy. The way Pokémon owns "catch 'em all."

**SupaSnake owns "infinite genetic empire."**
