## 6. Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

#### Risk 1: 60fps Not Achievable on Low-End Devices

**Likelihood:** Medium (30%)
**Impact:** High (retention killer if laggy)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Performance budget:** Max 500 particles on-screen, LOD (level-of-detail) system
2. **Extensive device testing:** Test on 30 devices (iPhone 8, Galaxy S8, budget Androids)
3. **Adaptive quality:** Auto-detect device capability, reduce VFX on <iPhone 11
4. **Profiling:** Use React Native Profiler, Three.js stats to identify bottlenecks

**Contingency Plan:**
- If <60fps on target devices (iPhone 11, Galaxy S10), reduce VFX complexity:
  - Max 200 particles (down from 500)
  - Disable trail VFX on low-end devices
  - Reduce shadow quality
- Target: 60fps on 95% of devices, 45fps acceptable on oldest 5%

---

#### Risk 2: Supabase Scaling Issues (>1M MAU)

**Likelihood:** Low (15%)
**Impact:** High (downtime = revenue loss)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Supabase Enterprise plan:** Dedicated resources, SLA guarantee
2. **Database optimization:** Index frequently queried tables (user_variants, breeding_history)
3. **Caching layer:** Use Redis for leaderboards, guild rosters (reduce DB load)
4. **Load testing:** Simulate 1M concurrent users (Months 10-11, before launch)

**Contingency Plan:**
- If Supabase can't scale, migrate to AWS RDS + custom backend:
  - Cost: $50k migration (1 month engineering)
  - Timeline: Month 11 (before global launch)
  - Benefit: Full control, better scalability

---

### Monetization Risks

#### Risk 3: Conversion Rate Below 25%

**Likelihood:** Medium (35%)
**Impact:** High (revenue miss, delays profitability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **A/B test battle pass price:** $4.99 vs $9.99 (Month 6 beta)
2. **Generous F2P:** Daily DNA rewards (500 DNA/day), daily free hatch
3. **First-time buyer bonus:** Double rewards on first battle pass purchase
4. **Social proof:** Show "50,000 players bought this season's pass!"

**Contingency Plan:**
- If conversion <15% after Month 6 beta:
  - Increase F2P generosity (1,000 DNA/day, 2 free hatches)
  - Lower battle pass price to $2.99 (test in select regions)
  - Add cheaper IAP ($0.99 starter pack)
  - Goal: Boost conversion to 20%+, even if ARPPU drops to $4

---

#### Risk 4: ARPPU Below $5

**Likelihood:** Medium (30%)
**Impact:** Medium (need more paying users to hit revenue target)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **DNA bundle pricing:** Offer high-value bundles ($9.99 = 10,000 DNA, 2× value)
2. **Limited-time offers:** Flash sales (24-hour 50% off DNA bundles)
3. **VIP system:** Monthly subscription ($14.99/month = daily DNA + exclusive variants)
4. **Cosmetics:** Sell skins, trails, nameplates (doesn't affect balance)

**Contingency Plan:**
- If ARPPU <$5 after Month 12:
  - Introduce VIP tier ($14.99/month, targets whales)
  - Add cosmetic shop (skins $2.99-$9.99 each)
  - Goal: Whales spend $50+/month, F2P casuals spend $5/month (average $8 ARPPU)

---

### Retention Risks

#### Risk 5: D1 Retention Below 40%

**Likelihood:** High (50%, industry average is 25%)
**Impact:** High (low retention = low LTV = unprofitable UA)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Daily challenges unlock early:** Level 3 (15 minutes play), not Level 10 (3 hours)
2. **Guaranteed rare on first hatch:** Immediate gratification, feels generous
3. **Streaks:** Daily login rewards (DNA increases per consecutive day)
4. **Push notifications:** "Your egg is ready to hatch!" (if breeding takes time)

**Contingency Plan:**
- If D1 <30% after soft launch:
  - Add instant-gratification mechanics:
    - First 3 breeds are instant (no wait time)
    - Starter pack: 3 epic variants unlocked at Level 1
  - Reduce friction:
    - Skip tutorial if returning user (don't force replay)
    - Faster onboarding (2 minutes vs 5 minutes)
  - Goal: Boost D1 to 35%+

---

#### Risk 6: D7 Retention Below 20%

**Likelihood:** Medium (40%)
**Impact:** High (low D7 = high churn = low LTV)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Week 1 progression rewards:** Day 3 = rare variant, Day 7 = epic variant
2. **Social hooks:** Invite friends for DNA bonus (500 DNA per referral)
3. **Guild benefits:** Joining guild gives 1,000 DNA welcome bonus
4. **Content cadence:** New variants every week (keeps collection fresh)

**Contingency Plan:**
- If D7 <15% after soft launch:
  - Add D7 comeback bonus: "You've been gone 7 days, here's 5,000 DNA + legendary hatch!"
  - Improve mid-game loop (Gen 5-10 feels grindy, reduce breeding costs 30%)
  - Goal: Boost D7 to 18%+

---

### Competitive Risks

#### Risk 7: SNAP or Supercell Clone SupaSnake

**Likelihood:** Low (20%, niche concept)
**Impact:** High (market saturation, price war)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Speed to market:** 12-month launch (vs 18-24 months for AAA studios)
2. **Defensible IP:** Dynasty lore, Snake gameplay (hard to clone exactly)
3. **Community moat:** Build loyal Discord community (100k members by Month 12)
4. **Network effects:** Guilds, ranked ladder (switching cost for players)

**Contingency Plan:**
- If major competitor launches similar game:
  - Pivot to niche: "The hardcore Snake experience" (skill-based, no pay-to-win)
  - Double down on esports (can't clone esports community easily)
  - Aggressive retention tactics (more generous F2P, exclusive content for loyal players)
  - Goal: Coexist by serving different audience (hardcore vs casual)

---

### Esports Risks

#### Risk 8: Low Tournament Viewership (<100k)

**Likelihood:** Medium (30%)
**Impact:** Medium (esports ROI questionable, but doesn't hurt core game)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Influencer partnerships:** Pay top streamers ($5k/month) to stream SupaSnake tournaments
2. **Twitch drops:** Watch 1 hour = free legendary variant (drives viewership)
3. **Professional production:** Hire casters, use instant replays, AR overlays
4. **Prize pools:** $25k monthly championships (attracts competitive players)

**Contingency Plan:**
- If viewership <50k after 6 months of esports push:
  - Scale back esports investment (reduce to $50k/year, grassroots only)
  - Focus on core game retention/monetization instead
  - Goal: Don't force esports if community doesn't want it

---
