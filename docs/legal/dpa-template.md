```

### Step 3: Execute DPA
```
- Sign via vendor's process
- Store executed copy in docs/legal/executed-dpas/
- Add to DPA tracking sheet (see below)
```

### Step 4: Monitor Sub-Processor Changes
```
- Vendors must notify of sub-processor changes
- Review new sub-processors (30-day objection period)
- Update DPA tracking sheet
```

## Common DPA Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Not signing DPA** - GDPR violation, ‚Ç¨10M fine
‚ùå **Using outdated DPA** - Vendors update terms, must re-sign
‚ùå **Ignoring sub-processor changes** - Must review and object if needed
‚ùå **No data deletion proof** - Keep certificates of deletion
‚ùå **No EU data residency** - US data centers may violate GDPR (Schrems II)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Request DPAs** - Email all vendors (see list above)
2. **Lawyer review** - Have lawyer review each DPA
3. **Sign DPAs** - Execute via vendor process
4. **Store copies** - `docs/legal/executed-dpas/`
5. **Track renewals** - Annual review (DPA tracking sheet)
6. **Monitor changes** - Sub-processor change notifications

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks (depends on vendor response times)
**Cost:** Included in $10k-15k legal budget
