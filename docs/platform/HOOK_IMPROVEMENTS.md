## 2025-10-14: SQL Injection Detection - False Positive Fix

**Issue:** Security hook `03-block-security-issues.sh` was blocking legitimate SQL arithmetic operations.

**Symptom:**
- Hook blocked writes containing SQL arithmetic like: `UPDATE users SET generation = generation + 1`
- False positive triggered by original regex pattern matching any plus operator
- Could not distinguish between arithmetic (safe) and string concatenation (dangerous)

**Root Cause:**
The original regex pattern matched ANY plus operator in SQL statements, including legitimate arithmetic operations.

**Fix Applied:**
Updated regex to detect plus operator **adjacent to quotes** (string concatenation pattern):

```bash
# Old pattern (too broad): Matched all plus operators
# New pattern (precise): Only matches plus adjacent to quotes
```

**New Behavior:**
- ✅ ALLOWS: Arithmetic operations (generation + 1, count + 5)
- ❌ BLOCKS: String concatenation with user input (injection risk)

**Impact:**
- Backend/Supabase system analysis can now include legitimate SQL examples
- Security protection maintained for actual SQL injection patterns
- Reduced false positive rate while maintaining security coverage

**Testing Performed:**
Verified hook allows arithmetic operations and still blocks string concatenation patterns.

**Files Modified:**
- `.claude/hooks/pre-tool-use/03-block-security-issues.sh` (lines 61-72)

**Recommendation:**
Consider adding similar precision improvements to other regex patterns in security hooks as needed.

## Future Improvements

**Potential enhancements to consider:**

1. **Context-aware checking:** Distinguish between documentation/comments vs. production code
2. **Whitelist mechanism:** Allow specific files to bypass certain checks (e.g., security test files, documentation)
3. **Severity levels:** Warning vs. blocking for different security issues
4. **Pattern library:** Centralized regex patterns shared across hooks
5. **Hook testing framework:** Automated test suite for all hook patterns
