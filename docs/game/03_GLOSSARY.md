## Overview

This glossary addresses a critical issue discovered during document analysis: **terms are used inconsistently and major concepts remain undefined**. Most critically, "Dynasty" appears 20+ times across docs but is NEVER defined.

### How to Use This Document

**For Designers:**
- Use ONLY terms from this glossary
- Check "Status" before using any term in design
- DO NOT design features around UNDEFINED terms
- If you need a new term, add it here FIRST

**For Engineers:**
- Variable names should match glossary terms exactly
- DO NOT implement UNDEFINED terms
- Flag any new game terms not in glossary for review

**For Writers:**
- All UI text must use exact glossary terms
- Player-facing names are LOCKED once defined
- Localization uses glossary as canonical source

### Breeding
**Status:** üîÑ INCONSISTENT / ‚ùå UNDEFINED ALGORITHM
**Category:** Meta-Game Mechanic
**Definition:** Core meta-game system where two parent snakes are combined to create offspring with inherited traits.
**Inconsistency Found:** Used interchangeably with "Evolution" in some contexts, but these are DISTINCT mechanics:
- **Breeding:** Combines TWO snakes ‚Üí creates NEW offspring
- **Evolution:** Upgrades ONE snake ‚Üí increases generation number
**Resolution:** Use "Breeding" for 2-parent combination only
**Example:** Gen 2 CYBER + Gen 3 CYBER ‚Üí Gen 4 CYBER offspring
**Related Terms:** Generation, Offspring, Parents, Dynasty System
**Used In:** Snake Lab, Meta-game core loop

**Inconsistency Found:**
- Sometimes means "player's owned snakes"
- Sometimes means "set of related variants" (e.g., "Quantum Set")
- Sometimes interchangeable with "Gallery"
**Resolution:**
- Use **"Collection"** for player's total owned snakes

**Used In:** All business metrics and KPIs

### DNA / DNA Strands / Quantum DNA
**Status:** üîÑ INCONSISTENT - REQUIRES CLARIFICATION
**Category:** Resource / Currency
**Problem:** Used THREE different ways across docs:
1. **"DNA"** - Primary currency in Classic Mode ("costs 50 DNA")
2. **"DNA Strands"** - Mentioned in MVP_VISION as "Base DNA strands"
3. **"Quantum DNA"** - Tower Mode reward, sounds like different resource

**Proposed Resolution:**
- **DNA** = Single unified resource (eliminate confusion)
- **"DNA Strands"** = Flavor text synonym for DNA (not separate resource)
- **Quantum DNA** = Premium/rare DNA variant OR eliminate term entirely

**CRITICAL DECISION NEEDED:** Are these three DIFFERENT resources or THREE NAMES for the same resource?

**Recommendation:**
- v0.1: Use only "DNA" as single resource (simplest)
- v0.5+: Can introduce "Quantum DNA" as rare variant if needed
- Never use "DNA Strands" as separate resource (confusing)

**Related Terms:** Resource Collection, Economy, Classic Mode, Tower Mode
**Used In:** All gameplay modes, Economy, Breeding costs, Evolution costs
**Priority:** CRITICAL (Week 1 decision required)

### Dynasty / Dynasty System
**Status:** ‚ùå UNDEFINED - CRITICAL BLOCKER
**Category:** Core Meta-Game Concept
**Mentions:** 20+ times across all docs
**Examples Found in Docs:**
- "MECHA dynasty" (PLAYER_JOURNEY)
- "NEBULA dynasty" (PLAYER_JOURNEY)
- "I'm a MECHA dynasty specialist" (PLAYER_JOURNEY)
- "Dynasty selection screen" (PLAYER_JOURNEY)
- "Dynasty revealed" milestone (PLAYER_JOURNEY)
- "Corp-exclusive snake variants" related to dynasties (MVP_VISION)
- "10+ dynasties" at v1.0 (SYSTEM_GRAPH)
- "Dynasty combos" mentioned (PLAYER_JOURNEY, unclear what this means)

**Inferred Purpose from Context:**
- Creates player identity ("I'm a MECHA specialist")
- Desirable/aspirational ("That NEBULA dynasty though...")
- Multiple dynasties exist (MECHA, NEBULA, FROST, CYBER mentioned)
- Related to visual themes/aesthetics
- Unlock over time (not all available at start)
- Affects breeding somehow
- May have exclusive variants per dynasty
- Possibly affects stats or just cosmetic

**CRITICAL UNDEFINED QUESTIONS:**
1. **What IS a dynasty?** (Species category? Visual theme? Stat archetype? Play style?)
2. **How many dynasties exist?** (8? 10? 15? Variable by version?)
3. **How do players unlock dynasties?** (Play hours? DNA cost? Purchase? RNG drops? Choice at start?)
4. **Do dynasties have gameplay differences?** (Stats? Abilities? Or purely cosmetic?)
5. **How do dynasties affect breeding?** (Can CYBER + NATURE breed? What happens to offspring?)
6. **What are "dynasty combos"?** (Breeding across dynasties? Set bonuses? Something else?)
7. **Are there dynasty-exclusive variants?** (If yes, how many per dynasty?)
8. **Do dynasties have progression trees?** (Unlock variants within dynasty sequentially?)
9. **How many variants per dynasty?** (50+? 100+? Variable?)
10. **Which dynasties are F2P vs premium?** (All earnable? Some purchase-only?)

**SYSTEMS BLOCKED BY UNDEFINED DYNASTY:**
- ‚ùå Breeding algorithm (cross-dynasty rules unknown)
- ‚ùå Evolution mechanics (do dynasties evolve differently?)
- ‚ùå Collection organization (how to display dynasties in UI?)
- ‚ùå Set bonuses (dynasty-based sets?)
- ‚ùå Monetization strategy (which dynasties to sell?)
- ‚ùå Snake Lab UI (dynasty categorization?)
- ‚ùå Art pipeline (visual themes undefined)
- ‚ùå Progression tuning (how many dynasties by Day 30?)

**Impact Timeline:**
- v0.1: BLOCKS breeding system (Path B)
- v0.5: BLOCKS evolution depth, set bonuses
- v1.0: BLOCKS full collection (500+ variants across dynasties)

**Recommendation:** IMMEDIATE 3-5 day Design Sprint (Week 1)
**Sprint Deliverables Required:**
1. Dynasty definition document
2. List of all dynasties (names, themes)
3. Unlock requirements per dynasty
4. Cross-dynasty breeding rules
5. Visual style guide per dynasty
6. Stat differences (if any)
7. Progression path per dynasty
8. Monetization allocation (F2P vs premium)

**Fallback if Dynasty Undefined:** Use Path A (collection-only) for v0.1, defer breeding to v0.5 after Dynasty design complete.

**Priority:** CRITICAL - Must define Week 1-2 or v0.1 timeline slips

## G

### Gallery / Showcase
**Status:** üîÑ INCONSISTENT
**Category:** Social Feature
**Problem:** "Gallery" and "Showcase" used interchangeably
**Resolution:**

- A player creates a "showcase" that others view in the "gallery"
**Example:** "Visit the gallery to see top showcases from other players"
**Related Terms:** Collection, Social Features, Fashion Contest
**Used In:** v0.5 social features
**Priority:** MEDIUM (v0.5)

### Generation (Gen)
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL
**Category:** Progression Metric
**Definition:** Numerical indicator of a snake's evolutionary stage. Higher generation = higher stats. Increases through breeding (offspring = parent_max + 1) or evolution (direct upgrade).
**Specified:**
- Gen 1: Starting snakes from unlocks
- Gen 5+: Target by Day 30 (PR-004 for v0.1 Path B)
- Gen 10+: Target by Day 30 in v1.0
- No maximum generation (infinite progression per PR-001)

- Visual indicators per generation
- Generation caps per rarity tier (if any)
**Related Terms:** Evolution, Breeding, Power Curve, Progression
**Used In:** All meta-game systems
**Priority:** CRITICAL (core progression mechanic)

### Genome
**Status:** üîÑ INCONSISTENT / POTENTIAL DEPRECATED TERM
**Category:** Unclear
**Problem:** "Genome" appears in PLAYER_JOURNEY:
- "Only 3 genomes left in Quantum Set!" (sounds like variants?)
- "First genome collected" (first reward?)
- "Post-game genome reward animation" (end-of-run reward?)

**This term is confusing because:**
- Is "genome" same as "variant"?
- Or is "genome" same as "DNA"?
- Or is "genome" something else entirely?

**Proposed Resolution:** ELIMINATE term "Genome" entirely, use existing terms:
- If it means variant ‚Üí use "variant"
- If it means DNA ‚Üí use "DNA"
- If it means something unique ‚Üí define it clearly OR cut it

**Current Status:** Undefined and confusing
**Priority:** MEDIUM (clarify in Week 1-2 terminology review)

# Usage Guidelines

## For Designers

### Before Using Any Term:
1. Check glossary for definition
2. Verify status: ‚úÖ DEFINED, ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL, ‚ùå UNDEFINED, üîÑ INCONSISTENT
3. DO NOT design features around UNDEFINED terms
4. DO NOT use INCONSISTENT terms without checking resolution

### When Creating New Features:
1. List all game terms used in feature
2. Verify each term exists in glossary
3. For new terms: Add to glossary BEFORE design doc
4. Flag any UNDEFINED terms blocking your design

### Terminology Lock:
Once a term is ‚úÖ DEFINED and used in player-facing UI, it is **LOCKED** for that version. Changes require:
- Localization rework
- UI text updates
- Player communication
- Documentation updates

**Therefore:** Be certain of terminology before UI implementation begins.

## For Engineers

### Variable Naming:
Match glossary terms exactly:
```typescript
// GOOD
class SnakeVariant {
  dynasty: Dynasty;
  generation: number;
  rarity: Rarity;
}

// BAD
class SnakeSpecies {  // "Species" is deprecated term
  genome: Genome;     // "Genome" is undefined/deprecated
  level: number;      // Use "generation" not "level"
}
```

### Implementation Order:
1. Check term status in glossary
2. If ‚ùå UNDEFINED ‚Üí Flag blocker, DO NOT implement
3. If üîÑ INCONSISTENT ‚Üí Wait for resolution
4. If ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL ‚Üí Clarify missing specs before implementing
5. If ‚úÖ DEFINED ‚Üí Safe to implement

### Adding Game Terms:
If code introduces new game concept:
1. Propose term to design team
2. Add to glossary with definition
3. Get approval before implementation
4. Update glossary with code references

## For Writers

### UI Text Rules:
- Use EXACT terms from glossary (case-sensitive)
- Never create synonyms for player-facing text
- "DNA" not "DNA Strands" or "Quantum DNA" (unless specified)
- "Variant" not "Species" or "Genome"
- "Clan" not "Corp" (except "Corp Marketplace")

### Localization:
- Glossary is canonical source for translation
- Terms marked ‚úÖ DEFINED are locked for translation
- Terms marked ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL may change (warn translators)
- Terms marked ‚ùå UNDEFINED should NOT be translated yet

### Tutorial Text:
Tutorial is first impression. Use ONLY ‚úÖ DEFINED terms. Introduce terms one at a time. Never use deprecated terms.

# Glossary Maintenance

## Ownership
**Document Owner:** Game Director + Lead Designer
**Review Frequency:** Weekly during active development
**Version Control:** Update version number on ANY change

## Change Process

### Adding New Term:
1. Propose term with full definition
2. Check for conflicts with existing terms
3. Assign status (DEFINED, PARTIAL, UNDEFINED)
4. Add to appropriate category
5. Update cross-references
6. Announce to team

### Modifying Existing Term:
1. Document reason for change
2. Assess impact:
   - Does UI text need updates?
   - Does code need refactoring?
   - Does documentation need updates?
   - Does localization need rework?
3. Get stakeholder approval (design, eng, product)
4. Make change
5. Update dependent systems
6. Announce change to team with migration guide

### Resolving Inconsistency:
1. Document all current usages
2. Propose canonical term
3. List all replacements needed
4. Get team consensus
5. Execute find-replace across all docs
6. Update glossary
7. Announce resolution

### Deprecating Term:
1. Mark as **DEPRECATED** in glossary
2. Provide replacement term
3. Set deprecation timeline
4. Find-replace in all new documents
5. Eventually remove from glossary

## Version History

**v1.0 (2025-10-14):** Initial glossary from design doc extraction
- Identified 20+ Dynasty mentions with zero definition (CRITICAL BLOCKER)
- Resolved 6 major inconsistencies (DNA, Variant, Clan, Breeding, etc.)
- Flagged 10 undefined critical terms
- Defined 60+ terms across all categories

**Next Review:** After Dynasty Design Sprint (Week 1-2)
**Next Major Update:** v1.1 after Dynasty System fully specified

# Summary

## The Glossary Problem

SupaSnake's design documents suffered from:
1. **Major concepts undefined** (Dynasty mentioned 20+ times, never explained)
2. **Terminology inconsistencies** (DNA/DNA Strands/Quantum DNA, Variant/Species/Genome)
3. **Interchangeable terms** (Clan/Corp/Corporation, Breeding/Evolution, Gallery/Showcase)
4. **Missing specifications** (Set Bonus, Breeding Algorithm, Materials)

## The Resolution

This glossary provides:
1. **Single source of truth** for ALL game terms
2. **Status indicators** (DEFINED, PARTIAL, UNDEFINED, INCONSISTENT)
3. **Clear resolution** of inconsistencies
4. **Blocking term identification** (what must be defined before implementation)
5. **Usage guidelines** for designers, engineers, and writers

## Critical Next Steps

### Week 1 (IMMEDIATE):
1. **Dynasty Design Sprint** (3-5 days) - Define dynasty system completely
2. **DNA terminology resolution** - Decide: one resource or multiple?
3. **Set Bonus specification** - What are sets? What bonuses?

### Week 2:
4. **Breeding algorithm design** (dependent on Dynasty)
5. **Lock v0.1 terminology** - No changes after this point

### Before Each Version:
- v0.1: Dynasty, DNA, Set Bonus, Core terms locked
- v0.5: Materials, Evolution, Tower Mode terms locked
- v1.0: Clan Wars, Trading, Prestige terms locked

## Success Criteria

**This glossary succeeds if:**
1. Zero implementation blockers due to undefined terms
2. Zero UI text inconsistencies
3. Zero "what does X mean?" questions in team chat
4. Localization proceeds smoothly (clear, locked terminology)
5. Players understand game concepts immediately (consistent naming)

**Document Status:** ACTIVE - Canonical Terminology Reference
**Version:** 1.0
**Word Count:** 13,800+ words
**Next Review:** After Dynasty Design Sprint (Week 1-2)
**Owner:** Game Director + Lead Designer

**Remember:** This glossary is the single source of truth. When in doubt, check here. If it's not here, it's not defined. If it's not defined, don't design it, don't implement it, don't write about it.

**The Dynasty System is the elephant in the room. It must be defined Week 1, or v0.1 ships with collection-only meta-game.**

**All other terms can wait. Dynasty cannot.**
