# SupaSnake MVP Vision: Endless grind and engagement machine

## The Platform Promise
**You're not playing Snake. You're running an engineering empire where Snake runs are just resource collection.**

Every snake run contributes to infinite progression. Every piece of resource collected unlocks new evolutionary paths. Every generation bred brings you closer to creating the ultimate snake species.

## The Core Loop (∞ Infinite)
```
Snake Lab (70% time) → Need Resources → Spend Energy → Play Snake (30% time)
    ↓                                                           ↓
Breed/Evolve Snakes ← Collect Resources ← Complete Run ← Mine Resources
    ↓
Show Off Collection → Social Competition → Need More Resources → [LOOP]
```

## Three Pillars of Engagement

### 1. Classic Mode - The DNA Mine
- **Purpose**: Predictable resource generation for daily Lab experiments
- **Energy Cost**: tbd
- **Session Length**: 5 minutes of focused collection
- **Rewards**: Base DNA strands, common evolution materials
- **Experience**: Relaxing gameplay providing steady progression

### 2. Tower Mode - The Rare Material Expedition
- **Purpose**: High-risk missions for exclusive Lab components
- **Energy Cost**: tbd
- **Session Length**: 15-45 minutes of strategic challenge
- **Rewards**: Prismatic Scales, Quantum DNA, Mythic Catalysts
- **Experience**: Prestige challenges for competitive players

### 3. Clan Wars - The Corporate Laboratory
- **Purpose**: Collaborate and compete as "Lab Corporations"
- **Energy Cost**: Generates bonus energy for clan members
- **Session Length**: 48-hour asynchronous territory battles
- **Rewards**: Corp-exclusive snake variants, trading opportunities
- **Experience**: Social collaboration creating community bonds

## The Meta-Game: Snake Lab

### The True Endgame
Snake Lab isn't a feature - it's THE GAME. Players discover that SupaSnake is actually:

1. **A Collection Game**: 500+ snake variants across 5 rarity tiers
2. **A Breeding Simulator**: Genetic combinations creating unique offspring
3. **An Evolution System**: Generation 1 → Generation ∞ progression
4. **A Social Gallery**: Showcasing and rating snake collections
5. **A Trading Economy**: DNA marketplace with corp-based commerce

### The Infinite Progression
- **No Ceiling**: Snake generations have no maximum (Gen 1, 2, 3... 50... 100...)
- **Expanding Content**: New DNA types added monthly
- **Prestige Systems**: Reset progress for permanent account bonuses
- **Mastery Tracks**: 200+ levels per snake variant
- **Achievement Chains**: Unlocking new chains as you complete others

## Energy: The Engagement Gate

Energy transforms Snake from unlimited casual play to strategic resource management:

- **Base Energy**: tbd
- **Max Energy**: tbd, (expandable through progression)
- **Energy Sources**: Time, ads, clan bonuses, premium purchases
- **Energy Sinks**: Classic, Tower, Special Events (varies)

This system creates:
- Regular play sessions (return when convenient)
- Meaningful gameplay (each run has value)
- Premium options (energy boosters for convenience)
- Social benefits (clan energy bonuses)

## Success Metrics

### Engagement KPIs
- **Meta-game Time**: 70% in Lab, 30% playing Snake
- **Session Frequency**: 3+ sessions daily
- **Session Length**: 15+ minutes average
- **30-Day Retention**: >20% (2x industry standard)

### Progression KPIs
- **Collection Depth**: 20+ variants per player by Day 30
- **Generation Progress**: Gen 5+ snakes by Day 30
- **Lab Investment**: 100+ upgrades/experiments
- **Clan Participation**: 40% of DAU in corporations

### Monetization KPIs
- **Day 7 Conversion**: 5% to paying
- **Day 30 Conversion**: 10% to paying
- **ARPDAU**: $0.50+
- **LTV**: $15+ per player
- **Ad supported tier

## Montetization through convenience (progress with less effort and faster, but almost same progress achievable F2P, but with significantly more effort and more time spent on the game), no Pay 2 Win, but slight advantages possible. 

## The Paradigm Shift

Traditional snake games focus on high scores and survival. SupaSnake shifts the entire paradigm:

| Traditional Snake | SupaSnake Platform |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Score is the goal | Score generates resources |
| Death ends the session | Death provides DNA samples |
| Cosmetics are decoration | Cosmetics have stats and bonuses |
| Playing is the activity | Playing is resource mining |
| Finite skill ceiling | Infinite progression layers |

## The Bottom Line

**SupaSnake isn't a Snake game with meta features.**
**It's an engineering empire that uses Snake as its resource collection mechanic.**

When players realize playing Snake is just the means to an end - and that the REAL game is the infinite progression of their genetic laboratory - they're already deeply engaged and loving the experience.

Welcome to the empire. Your snakes are waiting to evolve.
