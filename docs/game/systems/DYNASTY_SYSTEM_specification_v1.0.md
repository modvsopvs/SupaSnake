# Dynasty System Specification v1.0
## Production-Ready Design - LOCKED

**Version:** 1.0 FINAL
**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** 🔒 LOCKED - Ready for Implementation
**Priority:** CRITICAL - UNBLOCKS v0.1 DEVELOPMENT

---

## Executive Summary

**DECISIONS LOCKED - NO CHANGES AFTER THIS POINT**

The Dynasty System is now fully specified and ready for implementation. All 7 critical questions have been answered, all dependent systems are unblocked, and art production can begin Week 3.

### Core Decisions

1. **What IS a Dynasty?** → **Direction 4: Visual Art Theme + 5% Stat Bonus**
   - Dynasty = Midjourney-generated 2D art aesthetic + minor gameplay bonus
   - Example: CYBER = Neon tech aesthetic + 5% speed bonus

2. **How Many Dynasties?** → **3 for v0.1 MVP, expand monthly to 15+ in Year 1**
   - v0.1 (Month 1-3): 3 dynasties (CYBER, PRIMAL, COSMIC)
   - Post-launch: +1 dynasty per month (sustainable with Midjourney)

3. **Gameplay Impact?** → **Yes, 5% stat bonuses (strategic but skill > dynasty)**
   - CYBER: +5% speed
   - PRIMAL: +5% DNA generation
   - COSMIC: +5% size

4. **Unlock Method?** → **Progressive unlock (start with 1, unlock others via DNA)**
   - Tutorial: Choose 1 starter dynasty
   - Early game: Unlock 2nd for 2,000 DNA (Day 3-5)
   - Mid game: Unlock 3rd for 3,000 DNA (Day 7-10)

5. **Dynasty Mutability?** → **Immutable (permanent identity)**
   - Gen 1 CYBER → Gen 2 CYBER → Gen 3 CYBER forever
   - No dynasty transformation (can add as premium feature in v0.5 if desired)

6. **Breeding Rules?** → **Same dynasty only (v0.1 simplicity)**
   - CYBER + CYBER = CYBER offspring (100% inheritance)
   - Can expand to cross-dynasty in v0.5 based on player feedback

7. **Set Bonuses?** → **Yes, +10% DNA income per complete dynasty (stacking)**
   - Complete all 10 CYBER variants = +10% DNA bonus (permanent)
   - Complete all 3 MVP dynasties = +30% DNA total
   - Dynasty stat bonus doubles when complete (CYBER +5% → +10% speed)

### Art Strategy: Option A (Simple 3D Snake)

**Panini Book Collection (70% of playtime):**
- **2048×2048px Midjourney art cards** (gorgeous, zoomable, hi-res)
- Digital Panini sticker book interface
- Full-screen art zoom with lore text
- This is where the beautiful art shines

**Snake Gameplay (30% of playtime):**
- **Simple 3D snake model** (clean, smooth, 60fps performance)
- Color scheme + subtle pattern matches dynasty
- NOT trying to replicate full art detail (that's for the Lab)
- Focused on gameplay smoothness, not art showcase

**Visual Consistency:**
- CYBER snake in gameplay: Neon blue/pink gradient, circuit-like pattern on body
- CYBER card in Lab: Stunning Midjourney art (cybernetic snake, holographic scales, neon effects)
- Players understand: Collection art is the reward, gameplay is functional

### Production Timeline

**Week 1-2 (NOW):** Dynasty Design Sprint ✅ COMPLETE
**Week 3:** Art production begins (Midjourney generation)
**Week 4-5:** Art production continues + 3D snake models
**Week 6:** Backend implementation (database schema)
**Week 7:** UI implementation (Panini book + dynasty filters)
**Week 8:** Integration, testing, balancing

**Total: 6 weeks to full Dynasty System implementation**

### What Gets Unblocked

✅ **Art Production:** 2-3 weeks for 30 variants (vs 20 weeks for 500)
✅ **Art Budget:** ~$120 Midjourney Pro (vs $58,000 for 3D pipeline)
✅ **Breeding System:** Design complete, same-dynasty-only rules locked
✅ **Collection Lab UI:** 3 dynasty filters, 30 variant slots

## Art Production Pipeline

### Phase 1: Midjourney Art Generation (Week 3-4)

**Tools:**
- Midjourney Pro subscription ($60/month, unlimited fast generations)
- Upscaling: Midjourney's native upscaler (4K resolution)
- Export format: PNG, 2048×2048px

**Process per Dynasty (10 variants):**

**Day 1-2: Concept Exploration**
- Generate 50-100 Midjourney variations per dynasty theme
- Test different prompts, styles, compositions
- Example prompt evolution:
  - Base: "cybernetic snake, neon colors"
  - Refined: "cybernetic snake, neon circuit patterns, holographic scales, electric cyan and magenta, glowing LED edges, digital aesthetic, 4K"
  - Final: Add "centered composition, dramatic lighting, sleek metallic body, data stream effects"
- Select best 15-20 candidates

**Day 3-4: Variant Differentiation**
- For each of 10 variants, generate 5-10 iterations
- Ensure visual distinction:
  - CYBER SPARK: Simple circuit lines, minimal glow
  - CYBER OMEGA: Complex circuits, maximum glow, transcendent design
- Adjust prompts for rarity progression (Common → Legendary = simple → complex)

**Day 5-6: Final Selection & Upscaling**
- Choose 1 final image per variant (10 total per dynasty)
- Upscale to 2048×2048px using Midjourney upscaler
- Export as PNG (lossless, supports transparency if needed)
- File naming: `CYBER_SPARK_001.png`, `CYBER_OMEGA_010.png`

**Day 7: Quality Review**
- View all 10 variants side-by-side
- Check visual progression (Common → Legendary should be obvious)
- Ensure color palette consistency
- Verify no duplicates or too-similar designs

**Timeline per Dynasty:** 7 days
**Timeline for 3 Dynasties:** 14-21 days (can parallelize some work)

**Cost:**
- Midjourney Pro: $60/month × 2 months (for revisions) = $120 total
- **vs $58,000 for 3D art pipeline = 99.8% cost savings**

---

### Phase 2: Simple 3D Snake Models (Week 4-5)

**Tools:**
- Blender (free, open-source 3D modeling)
- Export: GLTF/GLB format (Three.js compatible)

**Base Model (Reusable):**
- Generic snake model: Smooth curves, segmented body (20-30 segments), tapered tail
- UV unwrapped for texture mapping
- Simple rig: Forward movement, turning (no complex animation needed)
- File size target: <500KB per model

**Dynasty Customization (Color + Pattern Texture):**

**CYBER Snake:**
- Base color: Cyan (#00FFFF) to magenta (#FF00FF) gradient shader
- Pattern texture: Circuit board overlay (subtle, 30% opacity)
- Material: Glossy, metallic shader (reflects environment)
- Particle system: Small cyan sparks emit when moving

**PRIMAL Snake:**
- Base color: Forest green (#2d5016) to brown (#8b4513) gradient shader
- Pattern texture: Vine/leaf overlay (organic, 40% opacity)
- Material: Matte, bark-like shader (rough, natural)
- Particle system: Green leaves drift behind when moving

**COSMIC Snake:**
- Base color: Deep purple (#4a0e4e) to gold (#ffd700) gradient shader
- Pattern texture: Star sparkle overlay (glittering, 50% opacity)
- Material: Semi-translucent shader (ethereal glow)
- Particle system: Golden stardust particles trail behind

**Implementation:**
- Create base snake model (2 days)
- Create 3 dynasty shader variants (1 day each = 3 days)
- Create 3 particle systems (1 day)
- Export to GLTF, integrate into Three.js (1 day)
- **Total: 7 days**

**No Need for 30 Separate Models:**
- Use 1 base model + 3 shader/texture variants
- Runtime: Swap shaders based on equipped dynasty
- Result: Tiny file size, instant dynasty switching

---

### Phase 3: Lore Writing (Week 3-4, Parallel)

**Per Variant (30 total):**
- **Lore Snippet:** 1-2 sentences, evocative, mysterious
- **Example (CYBER BLADE):** "Forged in digital fire and tempered by data streams, CYBER BLADE strikes with the precision of a thousand calculations. Its edges cut through the fabric of reality itself."

**Writer:** Can be AI-assisted (GPT-4, Claude) with human editing
- Generate 3-5 lore options per variant
- Select best, polish tone
- Ensure consistency within dynasty

**Timeline:** 1-2 hours per dynasty (10 variants) = 6 hours total

## Breeding & Set Bonus Systems

### Breeding Rules (Same Dynasty Only for v0.1)

**Requirements:**
1. **Both parents must be same dynasty** (CYBER + CYBER, not CYBER + PRIMAL)
2. **DNA cost:** 200 DNA base + (avg_parent_generation × 100)
   - Gen 1 + Gen 1 → Gen 2: 200 DNA
   - Gen 2 + Gen 2 → Gen 3: 400 DNA
   - Gen 5 + Gen 5 → Gen 6: 1,000 DNA
3. **Breeding timer:** Instant for v0.1 MVP (30 seconds in original design, instant for better UX)
4. **Both parents must be owned by player**

**Offspring Rules:**
1. **Dynasty:** 100% inheritance (CYBER + CYBER = CYBER, always)
2. **Generation:** max(parent1_gen, parent2_gen) + 1
   - Gen 1 + Gen 1 → Gen 2
   - Gen 2 + Gen 5 → Gen 6
3. **Variant:** Random selection from parent dynasty (50% parent1 variant, 50% parent2 variant)
   - CYBER SPARK + CYBER BLADE → 50% CYBER SPARK Gen 2, 50% CYBER BLADE Gen 2
4. **Stats:** Base stats + (generation × 5%)
   - Gen 1 base: Speed 10
   - Gen 2: Speed 10.5 (+5%)
   - Gen 5: Speed 12.5 (+25%)
   - Gen 10: Speed 15 (+50%)

**Breeding UI Flow:**
```
Lab → Breed Tab → Select Parent 1 → Select Parent 2 → Pay DNA → Instant Offspring Reveal → Add to Collection
```

**Breeding Animation (Instant for v0.1):**
1. Parent 1 and Parent 2 art cards float to center of screen
2. Cards merge together with particle effects (dynasty-themed: cyan sparks for CYBER, green leaves for PRIMAL, gold stars for COSMIC)
3. Flash of light
4. Offspring card appears (Gen 2, Gen 3, etc.)
5. Celebration confetti if offspring is new variant
6. "Added to Collection" confirmation

---

### Set Bonus System

**Set Definition:** Complete all 10 variants within a single dynasty

**Bonuses per Complete Dynasty:**
1. **+10% DNA income** (permanent, stacking)
   - Complete CYBER: +10% DNA
   - Complete PRIMAL: +20% DNA total (10% + 10%)
   - Complete COSMIC: +30% DNA total (10% + 10% + 10%)
2. **Dynasty stat bonus doubles**
   - CYBER base: +5% speed
   - CYBER complete: +10% speed

## Implementation Roadmap

### Week 6: Backend (5 days)

**Day 1-2: Database Schema**
- Create `dynasties`, `snake_variants`, `player_collection`, `dynasty_unlocks`, `set_bonuses` tables
- Add indexes and RLS policies
- Seed 3 dynasties (CYBER, PRIMAL, COSMIC) and 30 variants
- Test queries (ensure <50ms response time)

**Day 3: Supabase Storage Setup**
- Create `dynasties` bucket (public read)
- Upload 30 Midjourney PNG files (organized: `cyber/`, `primal/`, `cosmic/`)
- Generate CDN URLs, update `snake_variants.art_url` column

**Day 4: API Endpoints (Supabase Functions)**
- `GET /dynasties` - List all dynasties
- `GET /dynasties/:id/variants` - List variants in dynasty
- `POST /collection/unlock` - Unlock variant (deduct DNA, add to collection)
- `POST /collection/breed` - Breed 2 snakes (validate, create offspring)
- `GET /collection/:userId` - Get player's collection
- Test all endpoints with Postman

**Day 5: Set Bonus Logic**
- Implement `check_set_bonus()` function and trigger
- Test: Unlock 10th CYBER variant → verify bonus auto-granted
- Test: Apply +10% DNA income to gameplay rewards

---

### Week 7: Lab UI (5 days)

**Day 1: Panini Book Layout**
- React Native component structure:
  - `DynastyTabs.tsx` - Tab navigation (CYBER, PRIMAL, COSMIC)
  - `VariantGrid.tsx` - 10 variant cards per dynasty
  - `VariantCard.tsx` - Single card (locked/unlocked states)
- Basic layout (no art yet, placeholder images)

**Day 2: Dynasty Filtering**
- Implement swipe gesture to switch dynasties
- Dynasty color theming (change accent colors based on active dynasty)
- Progress tracking UI (6/10 Complete, progress ring)

**Day 3: Full-Screen Art View**
- Tap unlocked variant → full-screen modal
- Display Midjourney art (2048px PNG, pinch-to-zoom)
- Lore text, stats, rarity, generation info
- "Equip", "Breed", "Favorite" buttons

**Day 4: Unlock Flow**
- Tap locked variant → unlock dialog
- Show preview art (slightly dimmed)
- DNA cost, current DNA balance
- "Unlock for X DNA" button → deduct DNA, add to collection → celebration animation

**Day 5: Polish & Testing**
- Smooth transitions, animations
- Loading states (skeleton screens while fetching)
- Error handling (insufficient DNA, network errors)
- Test on iOS and Android devices

---

### Week 8: Breeding UI (3 days)

**Day 1: Parent Selection**
- Breed tab in Lab
- "Select Parent 1" → show player's collection (filtered by dynasty)
- "Select Parent 2" → show valid breeding partners (same dynasty only)
- Display DNA cost (calculated based on parent generations)

**Day 2: Breeding Animation**
- Parent cards float to center
- Particle effects (dynasty-themed)
- Offspring card reveal (instant for v0.1)
- Add to collection confirmation

**Day 3: Breeding History**
- View past breedings
- See offspring lineage (parent1, parent2 → offspring)
- Generation tree visualization (simple, not complex family tree)

---

### Week 9: Simple 3D Snake Integration (5 days)

**Day 1-2: Base 3D Snake Model**
- Create generic snake in Blender (20-30 segments, smooth curves)
- UV unwrap for textures
- Export as GLTF, integrate into Three.js scene

**Day 3: Dynasty Shaders**
- CYBER shader: Cyan/magenta gradient, circuit pattern texture, glossy material
- PRIMAL shader: Green/brown gradient, vine pattern texture, matte material
- COSMIC shader: Purple/gold gradient, star sparkle texture, semi-translucent material

**Day 4: Particle Systems**
- CYBER: Cyan sparks emit when moving
- PRIMAL: Green leaves drift behind
- COSMIC: Golden stardust trail

**Day 5: Runtime Dynasty Switching**
- Load equipped dynasty from player profile
- Apply correct shader + particle system
- Test switching between dynasties (should be instant, no lag)

---

### Week 10: Testing & Balancing (5 days)

**Day 1-2: Integration Testing**
- Full flow: Unlock variant → equip → play Snake → earn DNA → breed → new offspring
- Test all 3 dynasties
- Test on multiple devices (iOS, Android, different screen sizes)

**Day 3: Balance Tuning**
- Verify DNA costs feel fair (not too easy, not too grindy)
- Verify 5% stat bonuses are noticeable but not overpowered
- Simulate Day 30 progression: Can average player reach 20+ variants? (target: yes)

**Day 4: Set Bonus Testing**
- Unlock all 10 CYBER variants → verify +10% DNA income applied

## Monthly Expansion Playbook

**Goal:** Add +1 new dynasty per month post-launch (sustainable cadence)

### Process (7-Day Cycle)

**Day 1-2: Art Production (Midjourney)**
- Generate 50-100 concepts for new dynasty theme
- Example: "SHADOW Dynasty - dark, ethereal, wispy effects, monochrome black/purple"
- Select best 15-20 candidates
- Generate 10 final variants (Common → Legendary)
- Upscale to 2048×2048px PNG
- Export files: `SHADOW_UMBRA_001.png`, `SHADOW_VOID_002.png`, ..., `SHADOW_ECLIPSE_010.png`

**Day 3: Database Insert**
```sql
-- Insert new dynasty
INSERT INTO dynasties (name, display_name, description, color_primary, color_secondary, stat_bonus_type, sort_order) VALUES
('SHADOW', 'Shadow Dynasty', 'Born from darkness, masters of stealth', '#1a1a2e', '#16213e', 'evolution_speed', 4);

-- Insert 10 variants
INSERT INTO snake_variants (dynasty_id, name, rarity, art_url, lore_text, unlock_cost_dna, sort_order) VALUES
((SELECT id FROM dynasties WHERE name = 'SHADOW'), 'SHADOW UMBRA', 'common', 'https://.../SHADOW_UMBRA_001.png', 'Born from twilight...', 500, 1),
((SELECT id FROM dynasties WHERE name = 'SHADOW'), 'SHADOW DUSK', 'common', 'https://.../SHADOW_DUSK_002.png', 'Fades into darkness...', 500, 2),
-- ... (8 more variants)
((SELECT id FROM dynasties WHERE name = 'SHADOW'), 'SHADOW ECLIPSE', 'legendary', 'https://.../SHADOW_ECLIPSE_010.png', 'Total absence of light...', 10000, 10);
```

**Day 4: Supabase Storage Upload**
- Upload 10 PNG files to `dynasties/shadow/` bucket
- Verify CDN URLs are accessible
- Update `snake_variants.art_url` if needed

**Day 5: 3D Snake Shader**
- Create SHADOW shader in Blender:
  - Color: Dark purple (#1a1a2e) to black (#000000) gradient
  - Pattern: Wispy shadow trails (subtle, ethereal)
  - Material: Translucent, ghostly
- Create particle system: Black smoke particles drift behind
- Export GLTF, add to Three.js shader library

**Day 6: Testing**
- Verify new dynasty appears in Lab UI (4th tab: SHADOW)
- Test unlock flow (tap locked SHADOW UMBRA → unlock for 500 DNA → success)
- Test breeding (SHADOW + SHADOW = SHADOW offspring)
- Test set bonus (unlock 10/10 SHADOW → +10% DNA income granted)
- Test 3D shader (equip SHADOW snake → see dark purple/black snake with smoke trail)

**Day 7: Announcement & Deployment**
- Push to production (no app update needed, database already live)
- In-game notification: "NEW DYNASTY: Shadow - Born from darkness! Unlock now!"
- Social media announcement
- Monitor analytics (how many players unlock SHADOW in first 24 hours?)

---

### Expansion Metrics (Projected)

**Month 4:** Add SHADOW dynasty (+10 variants = 40 total)
**Month 5:** Add CRYSTAL dynasty (+10 variants = 50 total)
**Month 6:** Add EGYPTIAN dynasty (+10 variants = 60 total)
**Month 7:** Add NORSE dynasty (+10 variants = 70 total)
**Month 8:** Add FEUDAL dynasty (+10 variants = 80 total)
**Month 9:** Add STEAMPUNK dynasty (+10 variants = 90 total)
**Month 10:** Add MECHANICAL dynasty (+10 variants = 100 total)
**Month 11:** Add INFERNAL dynasty (+10 variants = 110 total)
**Month 12:** Add CELESTIAL dynasty (+10 variants = 120 total)

**Year 1 Total: 3 (MVP) + 12 (monthly) = 15 dynasties, 150 variants**

**Exceeds original plan of 10 dynasties, 500 variants** (can continue to 50 dynasties if desired, 500 variants achieved by Month 47 = ~4 years)

## What Gets Unblocked

### ✅ Art Production (UNBLOCKED)

**Status:** Can begin Week 3
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks for 30 MVP variants
**Cost:** $120 (Midjourney Pro) vs $58,000 (original 3D pipeline)
**Deliverables:** 30 × 2048px PNG art cards + 3 × simple 3D shader variants

**Next Steps:**
1. Subscribe to Midjourney Pro ($60/month)
2. Generate CYBER, PRIMAL, COSMIC art (Week 3-4)
3. Create simple 3D snake base model + 3 shaders (Week 4-5)
4. Proceed with implementation (Week 6-10)

## Appendix: Future Expansions (v0.5+)

**Cross-Dynasty Breeding (v0.5):**
- CYBER + PRIMAL = 80% dominant parent dynasty, 20% recessive
- Or 50/50 random split
- Adds strategic breeding choices ("I want CYBER, so I'll breed 2 CYBER to guarantee it")

**Dynasty Transformation (v0.5+):**
- Premium feature: "Dynasty Crystal" item ($1.99 or 5,000 DNA)
- Allows changing dynasty of existing snake (Gen 5 CYBER → Gen 5 PRIMAL)
- Monetization opportunity (not pay-to-win, just cosmetic flexibility)

**Dynasty Abilities (v1.0+):**
- CYBER: Data Hack (slow time for 3s, once per run)
- PRIMAL: Nature's Blessing (heal 1 collision after 30s)
- COSMIC: Warp (teleport short distance, once per run)
- High complexity, delay to v1.0 after core system proven

**Mega Dynasties (Year 2+):**
- Special rare dynasties released quarterly
- Example: "QUANTUM Dynasty - reality-bending snakes, 20 variants, ultra-rare"
- Higher DNA costs (20,000+ per variant), prestige collection goal
