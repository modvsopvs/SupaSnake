# UI Framework - 8-Level Consequence Analysis (Part 1: Levels 1-4)

**System:** UI Framework
**Tier:** 0 (Foundation)
**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-14
**Analyst:** Senior System Architect
**Status:** Levels 1-4 Complete

---

## System Overview

The UI Framework is the comprehensive interface layer that hosts ALL game screens, menus, and interactions in SupaSnake. This is not "just UI" - in a game where players spend **70% of session time in the Snake Lab** (CE-001), the UI Framework IS the primary game experience.

**Core Identity:** SupaSnake's paradigm shift ("Snake Lab is the real game") succeeds or fails based on UI quality. The Lab interface must be so compelling, intuitive, and satisfying that players willingly spend 7 minutes browsing their collection, planning breeds, and organizing dynasties for every 3 minutes of Snake gameplay. If the UI is clunky, slow, or confusing, the entire 70/30 paradigm collapses.

**Critical Success Factors:**
- **One-handed portrait orientation (UI-001):** All UI must work thumb-only
- **Thumb-optimized controls (UI-002):** 40% reachable screen area for primary actions
- **<100ms UI response time (UI-003):** Every tap feels instant
- **70% time in Lab (CE-001):** UI must be engaging enough to justify this split
- **Tutorial completion >85% (PLAYER_JOURNEY):** Onboarding must be smooth
- **Lab discovery >80% in Session 1:** Players must realize this isn't just Snake

**The Stakes:** If UI Framework fails to deliver Lab as a compelling destination, players will:
1. Treat Lab as "menu between Snake runs" (30/70 split instead of 70/30)
2. Bounce from game within 3 sessions (D7 retention <10%)
3. Never discover the meta-game depth (collection, breeding, dynasties)
4. Perceive game as "just another Snake clone"
5. Never convert to paying (no attachment to collection)

The UI Framework has the **most integration points** of any system (14+ systems depend on it) and the **highest risk surface area** (bad UI kills retention immediately).

## Dependencies

**Depends on:**
- None (Foundation tier, built in parallel with Core Snake and Backend)

**Depended on by:** (CRITICAL - 14+ Systems)
- Core Snake Game (HUD overlay, pause menu, end-of-run summary)
- Snake Lab (Collection browser, breeding interface, dynasty showcase)
- Energy System (energy display, refill prompts, depletion modals)
- Resource Collection (DNA counter, material inventory display)
- Classic Mode (mode selection, pre-game setup, results screen)
- Tower Mode (floor selection, challenge briefing, checkpoint UI)
- Collection Management (grid/list views, filters, sorting, detail panels)
- Breeding System (parent selection, timer display, offspring reveal)
- Evolution System (v0.5 - evolution tree, upgrade paths)
- Shop (store interface, purchase flows, bundles)
- Authentication (login/register screens, account management)
- Tutorial (guided onboarding, tooltips, progressive disclosure)
- Leaderboards (v0.5 - ranking tables, filters, friend comparisons)
- Clans (v0.5 - clan browser, member roster, chat interface)
- Gallery (v0.5 - showcase browser, voting interface)
- Clan Wars (v1.0 - war dashboard, territory map, contribution tracking)
- Settings (audio, graphics, accessibility, account)
- Analytics (UI event tracking, funnel visualization)

**Build Priority:** Tier 0, Week 1-2 (parallel with Core Snake)
**Critical Path Position:** Partial blocker - Core Snake can exist without UI, but nothing is **shippable** without UI. Week 2 integration required.

## Level 1: Direct Implementation

### Overview

The UI Framework is a comprehensive system providing screen management, navigation, component library, layout engine, theme/styling, animations, and accessibility. For v0.1, scope includes ~15-20 screens and 25+ reusable components, totaling 2,500-3,500 LOC.

**Critical Design Principle:** The Lab is the default screen, not a sub-menu. When the app launches, players land in Snake Lab, not a main menu. Snake gameplay is accessed FROM the Lab ("Play" button), not the other way around.

**Implementation Scope (v0.1):**

**Screens (15-20):**
1. **Snake Lab (Primary Hub)** - Collection grid, active snake, DNA balance, breeding slots, "Play" button
2. **Collection Detail** - Expanded snake view, stats, rarity, generation, equip/breed buttons
3. **Breeding Interface** - Parent selection, timer display, DNA cost, confirm/cancel
4. **Offspring Reveal** - Animation, stats reveal, "Add to Collection" button
5. **Snake Gameplay HUD** - Score, DNA, timer, energy, pause button
6. **Pause Menu** - Resume, restart, settings, quit to Lab
7. **End-of-Run Summary** - DNA earned, score, duration, "Return to Lab" button
8. **Energy Depletion Modal** - Out of energy, options: Wait (timer), Watch Ad, Purchase
9. **Shop** - Energy bundles, starter bundle, premium currency display
10. **Settings** - Audio sliders, graphics quality, accessibility, account
11. **Tutorial Overlay** - Tooltips, guided arrows, progressive disclosure
12. **Login/Register** - Email/password, OAuth buttons, guest mode
13. **Loading Screen** - App launch, mode transitions
14. **Dynasty Selection** (if Dynasty defined) - Choose starting dynasty, visual preview
15. **Achievement Toast** - "New snake unlocked!", "Gen 5 reached!"

**Components (25+):**
- Button (primary, secondary, text, icon, disabled states)
- Panel/Card (bordered container, elevated shadow)
- Modal/Dialog (overlay, close button, blur background)
- List/Grid View (scrollable, virtualized for performance)
- Tab Bar (navigation, active state indicator)
- Progress Bar (energy, timers, loading)
- Counter (DNA, score, animated increment)
- Icon (SVG, multiple sizes, semantic colors)
- Text (heading, body, caption, with text scaling support)
- Input Field (text, password, validation states)
- Toggle Switch (on/off, audio, settings)
- Slider (volume, graphics quality, continuous)
- Dropdown/Select (rarity filter, sort order)
- Badge (notification count, "NEW" indicator)
- Toast/Snackbar (temporary notification, auto-dismiss)
- Timer Display (countdown, MM:SS format)
- Snake Preview (3D model or sprite, rotating)
- Rarity Tag (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary)
- DNA Icon (currency icon, animated sparkle)
- Energy Icon (lightning bolt, depleted/full states)
- Avatar (player profile, circular crop)
- Loading Spinner (indeterminate progress)
- Empty State (no snakes yet, clear CTA)
- Confirmation Dialog (destructive actions, confirm/cancel)
- Tooltip (contextual help, tap to dismiss)

### Core Components

#### 1. Screen Management & Navigation (400-500 LOC)

**Screen Stack Model:**
```typescript
interface Screen {
  id: string;
  component: React.Component | View;
  params?: any;
  animation?: 'slide' | 'fade' | 'modal';
}

class ScreenManager {
  private stack: Screen[] = [];

  push(screen: Screen) {
    this.stack.push(screen);
    this.animate(screen, 'enter');
  }

  pop(): Screen | undefined {
    const screen = this.stack.pop();
    if (screen) this.animate(screen, 'exit');
    return screen;
  }

  replace(screen: Screen) {
    this.pop();
    this.push(screen);
  }

  reset(rootScreen: Screen) {
    this.stack = [rootScreen];
  }

  current(): Screen | undefined {
    return this.stack[this.stack.length - 1];
  }
}
```

**Navigation Patterns:**

**Hub-and-Spoke (Primary):**
```
Snake Lab (HUB) ←→ Collection Detail
       ↓
    Play Snake ←→ Pause Menu ←→ Settings
       ↓
  End-of-Run → Back to Lab
```

**Modal Overlays:**
- Energy Depletion Modal (overlay on current screen)
- Shop (modal from Lab or Energy Depletion)
- Achievement Toast (non-blocking overlay)
- Tutorial Tooltips (overlay, highlight target element)

**Deep Links:**
- Notification: "Breeding complete!" → Lab with offspring reveal
- Friend invite: "Join my clan!" → Clan screen (v0.5)
- Shop promotion: "50% off!" → Shop with bundle highlighted

**Back Button Behavior (Android):**
- If modal open: Close modal (not full back)
- If in sub-screen: Pop to previous screen
- If in Lab (root): Confirm "Exit app?" dialog
- Exception: During Snake gameplay, back = pause (not quit)

**Performance Optimization:**
- Virtual stack: Only render top 2 screens (current + previous for transition)
- Lazy loading: Load screen components on-demand (reduce initial bundle)
- Preloading: Prefetch Snake Lab components during login (reduce perceived load time)

**Target Metrics:**
- Screen transition time: <100ms (UI-003)
- Memory per screen: <5MB (allow 50MB total for 10 screens)
- Screen stack depth: Max 5 (prevent deep nesting, easier back navigation)

#### 2. Snake Lab (Central Hub) - 600-800 LOC

**Layout Structure:**
```
┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│ Top Bar (Fixed)                   │
│ DNA: 1,250  Energy: ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡    │ ← Always visible
├───────────────────────────────────┤
│ Active Snake Preview              │ ← Equipped snake, 3D/sprite
│ Gen 5 CYBER Starlight (Rare)      │
│ [Play] [Breed] [Evolve]           │ ← Primary actions
├───────────────────────────────────┤
│ Collection Grid (Scrollable)      │
│ ┌───┬───┬───┐                     │
│ │🐍│🐍│🐍│ [Filters: All ▼]       │ ← Dynasty, rarity filters
│ ├───┼───┼───┤  [Sort: Gen ▼]     │
│ │🐍│🐍│🐍│                        │
│ ├───┼───┼───┤                     │
│ │🐍│🐍│🐍│ [20 / 30 variants]    │ ← Progress indicator
│ └───┴───┴───┘                     │
│                                   │
│ [Scroll for more...]              │
├───────────────────────────────────┤
│ Bottom Nav (v0.5+)                │
│ [Lab] [Tower] [Clan] [Shop]       │ ← Thumb-reachable (UI-002)
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Critical UX Decisions:**

**Active Snake Section (Top Priority):**
- **Large visual:** 30% of screen (above fold, immediately visible)
- **Purpose:** Creates attachment, showcases player's current "champion"
- **Actions:** Play (most prominent), Breed, Evolve (secondary)
- **Feedback:** Pulsing glow if energy available, grayscale if depleted

**Collection Grid:**
- **Tile size:** 80x80px (thumb-tappable, UI-002 - min 44x44)
- **Grid layout:** 3 columns portrait (flexible for screen width)
- **Virtualized scrolling:** Only render visible tiles + 10 above/below (performance)
- **Filtering:** Dynasty (if defined), Rarity, Generation, Favorites
- **Sorting:** Generation (default), Rarity, Recent, Alphabetical
- **Empty slots:** Show "locked" variants (aspirational, creates desire)

**70% Time Justification:**
- **Browsing collection:** 2-3 minutes (150+ snakes by v1.0, lots to explore)
- **Breeding decisions:** 1-2 minutes (which parents? check stats, plan gen progression)
- **Managing timers:** 1 minute (check breeding slots, collect offspring)
- **Equipping snakes:** 30 seconds (try different snakes, compare stats)
- **Planning next goals:** 1 minute (which variant to unlock next? check DNA balance)
- **Total Lab time:** 5-7 minutes per session (70% of 7-10 min session)

**Performance Budget:**
- Collection grid render: <50ms for 30 tiles (v0.1)
- Scroll performance: 60fps (no jank during scroll)
- Filter/sort: <100ms to update (instant feel)
- Snake preview load: <200ms (3D model or sprite, async)

#### 3. Breeding Interface (300-400 LOC)

**Flow:**
```
Lab → Tap "Breed" → Select Parent 1 → Select Parent 2 →
  Review (show stats, cost, predicted offspring) → Confirm →
  Timer starts (30s) → Offspring Reveal → Add to Collection → Back to Lab
```

**Parent Selection UI:**
```
┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│ Select Parent 1                   │
│                                   │
│ [Collection Grid]                 │ ← Filter: Only Gen 2+ eligible
│ 🐍 🐍 🐍  [Same as Lab grid]      │
│ 🐍 🐍 🐍                          │
│                                   │
│ Selected: [CYBER Gen 3] ✓         │ ← Confirm visual
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Breeding Review Screen:**
```
┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│ Breeding Preview                  │
│                                   │
│ Parent 1: CYBER Gen 3 (Rare)      │
│     ↓                             │
│     🧬 (DNA strand animation)     │
│     ↓                             │
│ Parent 2: CYBER Gen 3 (Uncommon)  │
│                                   │
│ Predicted Offspring:              │
│ • Generation: Gen 4               │
│ • Rarity: Rare (50%) / Uncommon (50%)
│ • Stats: +15% over parents        │
│                                   │
│ Cost: 400 DNA  [Balance: 1,250]  │
│                                   │
│ [Confirm Breeding] [Cancel]       │ ← Destructive = secondary
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Timer Display (During Breeding):**
```
Lab screen with overlay:
┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│ Breeding in Progress...           │
│                                   │
│ Slot 1: [█████░░░] 12s remaining  │ ← Progress bar + time
│ Slot 2: [Empty]                   │
│ Slot 3: [Empty]                   │
│                                   │
│ Tap to view details               │
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Offspring Reveal (Emotional Payoff):**
```
Full-screen animation:
1. Egg cracking animation (1s)
2. Snake emergence (1s, particle effects)
3. Stat reveal (0.5s each stat, staggered)
4. Rarity announcement (0.5s, confetti if Rare+)
5. "Add to Collection" button appears

Total: 3-4 seconds (skippable after 1s)
```

**Critical UX:**
- **Prediction transparency:** Show players what they'll get (builds trust per GP-004 fairness)
- **Cost clarity:** DNA cost + current balance displayed prominently
- **Cancellation:** Easy to back out before confirming (no accidental breeds)
- **Timer visibility:** Persistent indicator in Lab (never forget breeding in progress)
- **Celebration:** Offspring reveal is **emotionally rewarding** (this is the payoff for Lab investment)

#### 4. HUD (Heads-Up Display) During Gameplay (200-300 LOC)

**Layout (Portrait, One-Handed UI-001):**
```
┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│ Score: 1,250    DNA: 75           │ ← Top corners (non-intrusive)
│ Time: 3:42      Energy: ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡│
├───────────────────────────────────┤
│                                   │
│          [Snake Gameplay]         │ ← Central area (no UI overlap)
│                                   │
│                                   │
│                                   │
│                                   │
├───────────────────────────────────┤
│              [Pause] ⏸            │ ← Bottom center (thumb-reachable UI-002)
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```

**HUD Elements:**

**Score Counter (Top-Left):**
- Font: Large (24pt), bold, high contrast
- Animation: +10 on food collect (number briefly enlarges)
- Color: White with black outline (readable on any background)

**DNA Counter (Top-Right):**
- Icon + number: 🧬 75
- Animation: Sparkle effect on increment
- Purpose: Constant reminder of resource generation (reinforces Snake = mining)

**Timer (Below Score):**
- Format: MM:SS (3:42)
- Color: White, turns orange at 5:00 (reminder of 5-min target)
- Purpose: Session length awareness

**Energy Display (Below DNA):**
- Visual: 5 lightning bolts (filled = available, gray = depleted)
- Purpose: Reminds player of energy cost (don't waste runs)

**Pause Button (Bottom Center):**
- Size: 60x60px (large tap target, UI-002)
- Position: Bottom 20% of screen (thumb-reachable)
- Style: Semi-transparent (not distracting during play)

**Performance:**
- HUD updates: <1ms per frame (text + icons only)
- No animations during gameplay: Only update on events (food collect, timer tick)
- Memory: <1MB for HUD (preload all assets)

**Critical Design:** Minimal HUD (no clutter), maximum readability, zero interference with gameplay. Players' eyes are on the snake, not the UI.

#### 5. Energy Depletion Modal (High-Stakes Moment) - 150-200 LOC

**Trigger:** Player taps "Play" with 0 energy available

**Modal Design:**
```
┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│         Out of Energy!            │
│                                   │
│         ⚡ 0 / 5                  │ ← Visual indicator
│                                   │
│ Energy refills in:                │
│         15:42                     │ ← Countdown timer (live)
│                                   │
│ Options:                          │
│                                   │
│ [Watch Ad (+1 Energy)] 📺         │ ← Opt-in, not forced (BM-002)
│                                   │
│ [Purchase Bundle] 💎              │ ← Monetization entry point
│   3 Energy - $0.99                │
│   10 Energy - $2.99 (Best!)       │
│                                   │
│ [Wait] (Return to Lab)            │ ← No pressure
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Critical UX Decisions:**

**Non-Aggressive Monetization (BM-004):**
- No "BUY NOW!" urgency language
- "Wait" option equally prominent (not hidden)
- Clear countdown timer (transparency, no dark patterns)
- Ad option available but not forced (BM-002)

**Timing:**
- First appearance: Session 2+ (not Session 1, per BM-004)
- Frequency: Every energy depletion (but no popups if player has energy)
- Dismissibility: Tap outside modal to close (not trapped)

**Performance:**
- Modal render: <50ms (instant appearance)
- Timer updates: Every 1 second (not every frame, saves battery)
- Ad availability check: Async, non-blocking (if ad network slow, show "Ad unavailable")

**Monetization Impact:**
- **Conversion Funnel:** Energy depleted → Modal shown → Purchase considered → Buy/Wait decision
- **Target:** 5% of players purchase within 7 days (CE-004 conversion target)
- **First Purchase Moment:** 30% of first purchases happen at this modal (critical conversion point)

#### 6. Component Library (800-1,000 LOC)

**Button Component:**
```typescript
interface ButtonProps {
  text: string;
  variant: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'text' | 'icon';
  size: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';
  disabled?: boolean;
  onPress: () => void;
  icon?: IconName;
  loading?: boolean;
}

// Primary Button: Solid color, high emphasis (Play, Confirm)
// Secondary Button: Outline, medium emphasis (Cancel, Back)
// Text Button: No border, low emphasis (Skip, Dismiss)
// Icon Button: Icon only, minimal (Settings, Close)

// Sizes:
// Small: 32px height (tertiary actions)
// Medium: 44px height (standard, thumb-tappable UI-002)
// Large: 56px height (primary CTA, extra prominent)
```

**Design System (Consistent Theming):**

**Colors:**
- Primary: #4A90E2 (blue, trust, modern)
- Secondary: #50E3C2 (teal, energy, vitality)
- Success: #7ED321 (green, completion)
- Warning: #F5A623 (orange, caution)
- Danger: #D0021B (red, destructive)
- Background: #1A1A2E (dark, premium feel)
- Surface: #25274D (cards, elevated)
- Text Primary: #FFFFFF (high contrast)
- Text Secondary: #AAABB8 (lower emphasis)

**Typography:**
- Heading 1: 32pt, Bold (screen titles)
- Heading 2: 24pt, Bold (section headers)
- Body: 16pt, Regular (content, readable)
- Caption: 12pt, Regular (metadata, timestamps)
- Scalable: Respect device accessibility settings (text scaling)

**Spacing:**
- Unit: 8px (consistent multiples: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48)
- Padding: 16px standard, 24px generous
- Margins: 8px tight, 16px standard, 24px loose
- Grid: 8px baseline (all elements align to grid)

**Animations:**
- Transition duration: 200ms (quick, responsive)
- Easing: ease-out (natural deceleration)
- Modal entrance: Fade + scale (300ms)
- Screen transition: Slide (250ms)
- Button press: Scale down 0.95 (100ms) - tactile feedback

**Accessibility:**
- Minimum touch target: 44x44px (UI-002, WCAG compliance)
- Color contrast: 4.5:1 minimum (WCAG AA, CO-003)
- Text scaling: Up to 200% without breaking layout
- Screen reader: Semantic labels for all interactive elements
- High contrast mode: Optional theme for visually impaired (v0.5)

#### 7. Layout Engine & Responsive Design (300-400 LOC)

**Device Categories:**

**Small Phones (iPhone SE, 375x667):**
- Grid: 3 columns (collection)
- Font: Base size 14pt
- Padding: Tight (12px)

**Standard Phones (iPhone 12, 390x844):**
- Grid: 3 columns
- Font: Base size 16pt (target)
- Padding: Standard (16px)

**Large Phones (iPhone Pro Max, 428x926):**
- Grid: 4 columns (more snakes visible)
- Font: Base size 16pt (no increase, just more space)
- Padding: Generous (20px)

**Tablets (iPad, 768x1024) - v0.5 Stretch Goal:**
- Grid: 5-6 columns (desktop-like)
- Font: Base size 18pt
- Two-pane layout: Collection (left) + Detail (right)

**Layout Strategy:**

**Flex-based (not fixed):**
- All containers use flexbox (vertical/horizontal stacking)
- Percentages for widths (not fixed pixels)
- Min/max constraints (prevent too small/large on extremes)

**Safe Area Insets:**
- Respect notch (iPhone X+): Top inset 44px
- Respect home indicator: Bottom inset 34px
- Status bar height: Dynamic (20-44px depending on device)

**Orientation:**
- **Primary:** Portrait (UI-001, optimized for one-handed)
- **Secondary:** Landscape (Snake gameplay only, Lab forces portrait)
- **Lock:** Lab screens are portrait-only (simplifies layout, enforces one-handed)

**Responsive Breakpoints:**
```typescript
const BREAKPOINTS = {
  small: 375,   // iPhone SE
  medium: 390,  // iPhone 12 (target)
  large: 428,   // iPhone Pro Max
  tablet: 768   // iPad (v0.5)
};

function getGridColumns(screenWidth: number): number {
  if (screenWidth < BREAKPOINTS.medium) return 3;
  if (screenWidth < BREAKPOINTS.large) return 3;
  if (screenWidth < BREAKPOINTS.tablet) return 4;
  return 5; // Tablet
}
```

### Technical Architecture

**Technology Stack Recommendation:**

**Framework Choice:** React Native (not React web, not Unity UI)

**Rationale:**
1. **Mobile-native:** True native performance (60fps, <100ms response UI-003)
2. **Cross-platform:** Single codebase for iOS + Android (Week 1-2 faster)
3. **Component ecosystem:** Mature library (react-navigation, react-native-reanimated)
4. **Hot reload:** Fast iteration during development (designer-friendly)
5. **Web port possible:** React Native Web for v1.0 if needed (same components)

**Alternatives Rejected:**
- **Web (HTML/CSS/JS):** Performance issues on mid-range devices, no 60fps guarantee
- **Unity UI:** Overkill for menu system, poor text rendering, huge bundle size
- **Native (Swift/Kotlin):** 2× development time (separate iOS/Android codebases)

**State Management:** Zustand (lightweight, simpler than Redux)

**Navigation:** React Navigation 6 (industry standard, performant)

**Animations:** React Native Reanimated 2 (60fps on main thread)

**Styling:** Styled-components (CSS-in-JS, theme support)

**Testing:** Jest + React Native Testing Library (component tests)

**Component Hierarchy:**
```
<App>
  <ThemeProvider>
    <NavigationContainer>
      <ScreenManager>
        <CurrentScreen>
          <Layout>
            <Components>
```

**Data Flow:**
```
User Action (Tap) → Event Handler → State Update (Zustand) →
  Re-render (React) → Layout (Flexbox) → Render (Native)
```

**Performance Optimizations:**

1. **Memoization:**
```typescript
const SnakeTile = React.memo(({ snake }) => {
  return <View>...</View>;
}, (prev, next) => prev.snake.id === next.snake.id);
// Only re-render if snake ID changes, not entire collection
```

2. **Virtualized Lists:**
```typescript
<FlatList
  data={snakes}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <SnakeTile snake={item} />}
  keyExtractor={snake => snake.id}
  initialNumToRender={9}    // 3x3 grid visible
  maxToRenderPerBatch={6}   // Add 6 more on scroll
  windowSize={3}            // Render 1 screen above/below
  removeClippedSubviews={true} // Unmount off-screen items
/>
```

3. **Image Optimization:**
- Preload active snake sprite on Lab load
- Lazy load collection tile images (on scroll)
- Use compressed formats (WebP on Android, HEIF on iOS)
- Resize images server-side (don't send 2048px images for 80px tiles)

4. **Async Rendering:**
- Split heavy operations (sorting 500 snakes) into chunks
- Use `requestIdleCallback` equivalent (InteractionManager)
- Show loading state during heavy operations (spinner overlay)

- Screen Manager: 400 LOC
- Snake Lab UI: 700 LOC
- Breeding Interface: 350 LOC
- HUD: 250 LOC
- Energy Modal: 150 LOC
- Component Library: 900 LOC (25 components × 36 LOC avg)
- Layout Engine: 350 LOC
- Theme System: 200 LOC
- Accessibility: 150 LOC
- Analytics Integration: 100 LOC
- **Total Core:** ~3,550 LOC

- **Total Additional:** ~1,650 LOC

**Grand Total:** ~5,200 LOC (v0.1 UI Framework)

**Development Time:**
- **Week 1:** Core framework (Screen Manager, Component Library, Theme) - 5 days
- **Week 2:** Snake Lab + Breeding interfaces - 3 days
- **Week 2:** HUD + Energy Modal - 2 days
- **Week 3 (Integration):** Wire up all screens to backend/gameplay - 3 days
- **Week 3 (Polish):** Animations, accessibility, responsive testing - 2 days
- **Total:** 15 days (3 weeks with buffer)

**Team Size:** 2 frontend engineers (can parallelize screen development)

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH
- **Known Patterns:** UI development is well-understood
- **Complexity:** 15+ screens, 25+ components is significant scope
- **Polish Critical:** UI must feel AAA or paradigm fails (high bar)
- **Integration Surface:** 14+ systems depend on UI (lots of coordination)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start with component library (Week 1) - foundation for all screens
  - Daily design reviews (catch UX issues early)
  - Continuous device testing (iPhone SE to Pro Max)
  - 3-day polish buffer (Week 3) - no new features, only refinement

### Critical Technical Decisions

#### Decision 1: Framework Choice (React Native vs Web vs Unity)

**Options:**
- **A) React Native:** Cross-platform native (iOS, Android from single codebase)
- **B) React Web (PWA):** Web-based, browser deployment
- **C) Unity UI:** Game engine UI system
- **D) Native (Swift/Kotlin):** Separate iOS and Android codebases

**Chosen:** A (React Native)

**Rationale:**

**React Native Pros:**
- Native performance (60fps, <100ms UI-003 achievable)
- Cross-platform (1 codebase = 2 platforms, 50% time savings)
- Component ecosystem (React Navigation, Reanimated, massive library)
- Hot reload (fast iteration, designer-friendly)
- Large talent pool (React is common skill)
- Future web port possible (React Native Web)

**React Native Cons:**
- Bridge overhead (JS ↔ Native, mitigated by new architecture)
- Larger bundle size than native (acceptable for mobile game)
- Some platform-specific code needed (5-10% of codebase)

**Web (PWA) Rejected:**
- Performance inconsistent on mid-range Android (can't guarantee 60fps)
- No native feel (scroll inertia, haptics, gestures)
- App store distribution harder (users expect native apps)
- Offline support weaker (Service Workers vs native offline)

**Unity UI Rejected:**
- Overkill for menu system (Unity is for 3D rendering, not UI)
- Text rendering poor (blurry on high-DPI screens)
- Bundle size huge (100MB+ for Unity runtime)
- UI iteration slow (recompile for changes)

**Native (Swift/Kotlin) Rejected:**
- 2× development time (separate iOS/Android)
- 2× maintenance burden (fix bugs twice)
- Not worth time investment for v0.1 (optimize later if needed)

**Final Decision:** React Native balances performance, development speed, and cross-platform reach. It's the industry standard for mobile game UI (see: Call of Duty Mobile, PUBG Mobile UI layers).

#### Decision 2: State Management (Redux vs Zustand vs Context)

**Options:**
- **A) Redux:** Industry standard, verbose, powerful
- **B) Zustand:** Lightweight, simple, fast
- **C) React Context:** Built-in, minimal setup

**Chosen:** B (Zustand)

**Rationale:**

**Zustand Pros:**
- Minimal boilerplate (define store in 20 LOC vs 200 LOC Redux)
- Fast performance (direct subscriptions, no context overhead)
- Small bundle size (1KB vs 10KB Redux)
- Easy to learn (1-day ramp-up vs 1-week Redux)
- Sufficient for v0.1 (not building Facebook, just Snake Lab)

**Redux Rejected:**
- Over-engineered for v0.1 (actions, reducers, middleware = complexity)
- Slower iteration (more code to change)
- Only needed if >10 engineers working on codebase (not our case)

**React Context Rejected:**
- Performance issues with frequent updates (re-renders entire tree)
- No built-in selectors (Zustand has optimized subscriptions)
- Verbose for complex state (nested contexts)

**Example Zustand Store:**
```typescript
import create from 'zustand';

const useGameStore = create((set) => ({
  dna: 0,
  energy: 5,
  activeSnake: null,

  addDNA: (amount) => set((state) => ({ dna: state.dna + amount })),
  consumeEnergy: () => set((state) => ({ energy: Math.max(0, state.energy - 1) })),
  setActiveSnake: (snake) => set({ activeSnake: snake }),
}));

// Usage in component:
const { dna, addDNA } = useGameStore();
```

**Migration Path:** If app grows beyond 10 engineers in v1.0+, Zustand → Redux is straightforward (similar patterns).

#### Decision 3: Navigation Library (React Navigation vs Expo Router)

**Options:**
- **A) React Navigation 6:** Mature, configurable, stack-based
- **B) Expo Router:** File-based routing (like Next.js), newer

**Chosen:** A (React Navigation 6)

**Rationale:**
- Battle-tested (5+ years production use)
- Performant stack management (lazy loading, unmounting)
- Native gesture handling (swipe to go back on iOS)
- Customizable transitions (slide, fade, modal)
- Large community (Stack Overflow answers available)

**Expo Router Rejected:**
- Too new (released 2023, not proven at scale)
- File-based routing unnecessary (we have 15 screens, not 100)
- Opinionated structure (less control over navigation flow)

#### Decision 4: Snake Lab as Default Screen (vs Main Menu)

**Options:**
- **A) Snake Lab as root:** App launches directly into Lab
- **B) Main Menu as root:** Traditional game menu (Play, Settings, Quit)

**Chosen:** A (Snake Lab as root)

**Rationale:**

**Critical to Paradigm Shift:**
- **Main Menu signals:** "This is a Snake game" (wrong message)
- **Lab as default signals:** "This is a collection/breeding game" (correct paradigm)
- **Player Journey:** PLAYER_JOURNEY specifies "Lab discovery within 2-5 minutes" - launching INTO Lab = instant discovery
- **70/30 Time Split:** If Lab is submenu, players treat it as optional - if Lab is home, players MUST engage

**User Flow Comparison:**

**Traditional (Main Menu root):**
```
Launch → Main Menu → Play Snake → End-of-Run → Back to Main Menu
(Lab is hidden in "Collection" submenu, 30% discovery rate)
```

**SupaSnake (Lab root):**
```
Launch → Snake Lab (default) → See Collection → Tap "Play" → Snake Run →
  Back to Lab (with new DNA) → Immediate Lab engagement
(Lab discovery = 100%, paradigm shift immediate)
```

**Objection Handling:**
- "What about settings?" → Settings icon in top-right of Lab (persistent)
- "What about tutorial?" → Tutorial overlays ON TOP of Lab (contextual)
- "What if player just wants to play Snake?" → "Play" button is prominent, but AFTER seeing Lab

**Result:** Lab-as-default is non-negotiable. This IS the paradigm shift.

#### Decision 5: Collection View (Grid vs List vs Hybrid)

**Options:**
- **A) Grid-only:** Pinterest-style tiles (visual focus)
- **B) List-only:** Instagram-style rows (information-dense)
- **C) Hybrid:** Toggle between Grid and List views

**Chosen:** A (Grid-only for v0.1), add C (Hybrid) in v0.5 if requested

**Rationale:**

**Grid Pros:**
- Visual showcase (snakes are visually distinct, grid highlights aesthetics)
- More snakes visible per screen (3×3 = 9 snakes vs 4-5 list rows)
- Touch-friendly (80x80px tiles are easy to tap)
- Aspirational (empty slots create "gotta catch 'em all" feeling)

**List Pros:**
- More information per snake (stats inline)
- Easier to compare (side-by-side stats)
- Better for text-heavy content (not our case)

**Hybrid (v0.5):**
- Add toggle button: [Grid 🔲] [List ☰]
- Save preference: User's choice persists
- Implementation: Same data, different render function (100 LOC)

**v0.1 Decision:** Grid-only (simpler, faster to build, visually stronger). Validate with users, add List view in v0.5 if >20% request it.

---

## Level 2: Immediate System Effects

### Integration Points

The UI Framework integrates with MORE systems than any other component (14+). Each integration requires careful coordination of data flow, event handling, and error states.

#### 1. Core Snake Game Integration

**Data Exchange:**
- **UI → Snake:** Start game command, pause/resume, restart requests
- **Snake → UI:** Score updates, DNA collected, run duration, death event

**HUD Update Frequency:**
- Score: Every food collection (~1-2 seconds, event-driven)
- DNA: Calculated once on death (not real-time during play)
- Timer: Every second (setInterval, not every frame)
- Energy: Static during run (no updates mid-game)

**Update Pattern:**
```typescript
// Event-driven (not polling)
SnakeGame.on('FOOD_COLLECTED', (score) => {
  HUD.updateScore(score); // <1ms update
});

SnakeGame.on('GAME_OVER', (results) => {
  HUD.hide();
  EndOfRunSummary.show(results); // Transition to summary screen
});
```

**Performance:**
- HUD updates: <1ms per event (text + icon rendering)
- No DOM manipulation: Native views only (faster than web)
- No layout shifts: Fixed positions (no reflow on update)

**Failure Handling:**
- HUD render fails: Gameplay continues (degrade gracefully, no crash)
- Score display error: Correct total saved to backend (client display bug doesn't corrupt data)
- Timer stops updating: Visual bug only, actual duration tracked server-side

#### 2. Snake Lab (Collection, Breeding, Energy) Integration

**Data Sources:**
- **Collection System:** List of owned snakes (id, dynasty, gen, rarity, stats)
- **Breeding System:** Active breeding timers (slot 1-3, remaining time, parent IDs)
- **Energy System:** Current energy (0-5), max energy, recharge time

**Real-Time Updates:**
- **Collection changes:** Breeding completes → new snake → add to grid (websocket or polling)
- **Energy recharge:** Every 20 minutes → increment energy counter (polling every 10s)
- **Breeding timers:** Every second → update progress bars (local countdown)

**Data Flow:**
```
Backend (Supabase Real-time) → Zustand Store → React Re-render → UI Update
                                    ↓
                              Component subscribes to specific slice
                                    ↓
                            Only re-render if subscribed data changed
```

**Optimization (Critical for 60fps):**
```typescript
// Bad: Re-renders entire Lab on any state change
const Lab = () => {
  const state = useGameStore(); // All state
  return <LabView state={state} />;
};

// Good: Only re-renders on DNA change
const DNACounter = () => {
  const dna = useGameStore((state) => state.dna); // Slice only
  return <Text>{dna} DNA</Text>;
};
```

**Performance Budget:**
- Lab initial render: <200ms (acceptable, not performance-critical)
- Collection grid scroll: 60fps (virtualized list, critical)
- Breeding timer updates: <5ms per second (1-3 timers × text update)
- Energy display updates: <2ms (icon change + number)

#### 3. Energy System Integration (Critical Monetization Flow)

**Energy Check Flow:**
```
User taps "Play" → UI checks Energy > 0?
   ↓ YES                    ↓ NO
Start Snake Game      Show Energy Modal
                         ↓
                   [Wait / Watch Ad / Purchase]
                         ↓
                   User decides → Update energy → Retry or Close
```

**Energy Depletion Modal (High-Stakes Moment):**

**Purchase Flow:**
```
Modal → Tap "Purchase Bundle" → Shop Screen (modal) → Select bundle →
  IAP (Apple/Google) → Payment processing → Success →
  Energy updated → Modal dismisses → "Play" now available
```

**Purchase Flow Technical:**
```typescript
async function purchaseEnergyBundle(bundleId: string) {
  // 1. Show loading state
  setLoading(true);

  // 2. Initiate IAP
  const purchase = await IAP.requestPurchase(bundleId);

  // 3. Verify with backend (prevent fraud)
  const receipt = await IAP.getReceipt(purchase);
  const verified = await Backend.verifyPurchase(receipt);

  if (verified) {
    // 4. Update energy locally (optimistic)
    useGameStore.setState({ energy: energy + 3 });

    // 5. Dismiss modal, show success toast
    Modal.dismiss();
    Toast.show("3 Energy added!");
  } else {
    // 6. Verification failed (fraud detected)
    Toast.show("Purchase failed. Contact support.");
  }

  setLoading(false);
}
```

**Watch Ad Flow:**
```
Modal → Tap "Watch Ad" → Check ad availability →
  ↓ Available                        ↓ Not Available
Load ad (5s) → Play ad (30s) → Reward +1 energy → Modal dismisses
                                         ↓ User closes early
                                   No reward (ad must complete)

Toast: "Ad unavailable" → Gray out button
```

**Ad Integration:**
```typescript
async function watchAdForEnergy() {
  if (!AdNetwork.isAdAvailable()) {
    Toast.show("Ad unavailable, try again later");
    return;
  }

  // 1. Load ad (may take 5-10 seconds)
  setLoading(true);
  const ad = await AdNetwork.loadRewardedAd();
  setLoading(false);

  // 2. Show ad (user watches 30s)
  const completed = await AdNetwork.showAd(ad);

  if (completed) {
    // 3. Reward energy (server-side verification)
    await Backend.rewardAdEnergy();
    useGameStore.setState({ energy: energy + 1 });

    Toast.show("+1 Energy for watching ad!");
    Modal.dismiss();
  } else {
    // User closed ad early, no reward
    Toast.show("Watch complete ad for reward");
  }
}
```

**Failure Modes:**
- Ad network timeout (10s): Show "Ad unavailable", don't trap user
- IAP fails: Show error, don't deduct energy or money
- Network failure: Queue purchase locally, retry on reconnect
- Double-purchase bug: Backend deduplicates by transaction ID

**Conversion Tracking:**
```typescript
// Critical analytics events
Analytics.track('ENERGY_DEPLETED', { session_count, dna_in_session });
Analytics.track('ENERGY_MODAL_SHOWN', { options: ['wait', 'ad', 'purchase'] });
Analytics.track('AD_WATCHED', { energy_rewarded: 1 });
Analytics.track('ENERGY_PURCHASED', { bundle_id, price, energy_amount });
Analytics.track('MODAL_DISMISSED', { action: 'wait' | 'purchase' | 'ad' });

// Funnel analysis:
// Energy Depleted (100%) → Modal Shown (100%) →
//   Purchase (5%) | Ad (20%) | Wait (75%)
```

**Monetization Impact:**
- **30% of first purchases** happen at Energy Modal (PLAYER_JOURNEY data)
- **Conversion rate target:** 5% of energy depletions → purchase (CE-004)
- **Ad watch rate:** 20-30% of players watch ad when depleted (optional engagement)

#### 4. Shop Integration

**Shop Entry Points:**
- Energy Depletion Modal: "Purchase Bundle" button
- Lab UI: Persistent "Shop" icon (top-right or bottom nav)
- Push notification: "50% off starter bundle!" → Deep link to shop

**Shop Layout:**
```
┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│ Shop                      [Close] │
├───────────────────────────────────┤
│ Featured:                         │
│ ┌───────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ Starter Bundle (80% OFF!)     │ │ ← Day 3-5 only (BM-004)
│ │ 20 Energy + 1000 DNA + Rare   │ │
│ │ $2.99 (was $14.99)            │ │
│ │ [Buy Now]                     │ │

│ [30 Energy - $7.99]               │
├───────────────────────────────────┤
│ Premium Currency:                 │

├───────────────────────────────────┤
│ Exclusive Dynasties (v0.5):      │
│ [QUANTUM Dynasty - $9.99]         │
│ [NEBULA Dynasty - $7.99]          │
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Purchase Flow UI:**
```
Tap "Buy Now" → Confirmation Dialog →
  "Confirm purchase of Starter Bundle for $2.99?"
  [Confirm] [Cancel]
    ↓ Confirm
  Loading spinner (IAP processing, 2-10s)
    ↓ Success
  Success animation (confetti, checkmark)
  Toast: "Starter Bundle received!"
  Items added to account (energy, DNA, snake unlocked)
  Shop remains open (for additional purchases)
```

**IAP Platform Integration:**
```typescript
// iOS (StoreKit) / Android (Play Billing)
import * as IAP from 'react-native-iap';

async function initializeShop() {
  // 1. Connect to store
  await IAP.initConnection();

  // 2. Fetch product listings (price, description)
  const products = await IAP.getProducts(['starter_bundle', 'energy_3', 'energy_10']);

  // 3. Populate shop UI with prices
  setShopProducts(products);
}

async function purchaseProduct(productId: string) {
  try {
    // 1. Request purchase
    const purchase = await IAP.requestPurchase(productId);

    // 2. Get receipt
    const receipt = purchase.transactionReceipt;

    // 3. Verify with backend (critical anti-fraud step)
    const result = await Backend.verifyAndRedeemPurchase(receipt);

    if (result.success) {
      // 4. Update UI (optimistic, already redeemed server-side)
      applyPurchaseRewards(result.rewards);
      showSuccessAnimation();
    }

    // 5. Finish transaction (required, or purchase repeats)
    await IAP.finishTransaction(purchase);

  } catch (error) {
    if (error.code === 'E_USER_CANCELLED') {
      // User closed IAP dialog, no action needed
    } else {
      // Payment failed or network error
      Alert.show("Purchase failed", error.message);
    }
  }
}
```

**Failure Handling:**
- Network timeout: Queue purchase, retry on reconnect (don't lose player's money)
- Store unreachable: Disable shop buttons, show "Store unavailable"
- Receipt verification fails: Show "Contact support" with transaction ID
- Double-purchase bug: Backend deduplicates by transaction ID (idempotent)

**Analytics:**
```typescript
Analytics.track('SHOP_OPENED', { entry_point: 'energy_modal' | 'lab_icon' | 'notification' });
Analytics.track('PRODUCT_VIEWED', { product_id, price });
Analytics.track('PURCHASE_STARTED', { product_id });
Analytics.track('PURCHASE_COMPLETED', { product_id, price, currency });
Analytics.track('PURCHASE_FAILED', { product_id, error_code });

// Conversion funnel:
// Shop Opened (100%) → Product Viewed (80%) →
//   Purchase Started (10%) → Completed (8%) [2% abandon/fail]
```

#### 5. Tutorial System Integration

**Tutorial Overlay Approach:**
```
Base Screen (Lab) → Tutorial Layer (semi-transparent overlay) →
  Highlighted Element (spotlight) → Tooltip (instruction)
```

**Tutorial Steps (Example: First Session):**
```
Step 1: "Welcome to SupaSnake!"
  - Overlay entire Lab
  - Modal: "This is your Snake Lab..."
  - Action: Tap "Got it"

Step 2: "This is your Active Snake"
  - Spotlight: Active snake preview (top)
  - Tooltip: "Your current champion"
  - Action: Tap anywhere to continue

Step 3: "Tap Play to collect DNA"
  - Spotlight: Play button
  - Tooltip: "Spend 1 energy to play Snake"
  - Action: Tap Play button (forced interaction)

Step 4: [During first Snake run]
  - Swipe tutorial (show swipe directions)
  - Food collection (celebrate first food)

Step 5: [After first run ends]
  - Spotlight: DNA counter
  - Tooltip: "You earned 95 DNA!"
  - Action: Continue

Step 6: "Browse your collection"
  - Spotlight: Collection grid
  - Tooltip: "Collect snakes, unlock new variants"
  - Action: Tap any snake

Step 7: "Breed two snakes"
  - Spotlight: Breed button
  - Tooltip: "Combine snakes to create offspring"
  - Action: Optional (can skip, or guide through first breed)

Step 8: Tutorial complete
  - Modal: "You've mastered the basics!"
  - Reward: +500 DNA bonus
  - Action: Dismiss, full Lab access
```

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
interface TutorialStep {
  id: string;
  screen: string;
  highlightElement?: string; // CSS selector or component ref
  tooltip: {
    text: string;
    position: 'top' | 'bottom' | 'left' | 'right';
  };
  action: 'tap' | 'swipe' | 'wait' | 'complete';
  blocksInteraction?: boolean; // Force action or allow skip?
}

const tutorialSteps: TutorialStep[] = [
  {
    id: 'welcome',
    screen: 'Lab',
    tooltip: { text: "Welcome to SupaSnake! This is your Lab...", position: 'center' },
    action: 'tap',
    blocksInteraction: false
  },
  // ... more steps
];

function showTutorialStep(step: TutorialStep) {
  // 1. Dim background (overlay)
  setOverlay(true);

  // 2. Highlight target element (spotlight)
  if (step.highlightElement) {
    highlightElement(step.highlightElement);
  }

  // 3. Show tooltip
  showTooltip(step.tooltip);

  // 4. Wait for action
  if (step.blocksInteraction) {
    // User MUST complete action to continue
    blockAllInteractions();
    onlyAllowInteractionWith(step.highlightElement);
  } else {
    // User can skip
    showSkipButton();
  }
}
```

**Completion Tracking:**
```typescript
Analytics.track('TUTORIAL_STARTED', { timestamp });
Analytics.track('TUTORIAL_STEP_COMPLETED', { step_id, duration });
Analytics.track('TUTORIAL_SKIPPED', { step_id }); // If user skips
Analytics.track('TUTORIAL_COMPLETED', { duration, steps_completed, steps_skipped });

// Target: >85% completion (PLAYER_JOURNEY acceptance criteria)
// Current industry: ~60% completion (many players skip)
// Strategy: Make steps FAST (10-20 seconds each), skippable, rewarding
```

**Tutorial Failure Modes:**
- User backgrounds app during tutorial: Resume from last step
- Tutorial bugs (highlight wrong element): Graceful fallback (no highlight, just tooltip)
- User force-quits during tutorial: Restart tutorial on next launch (but shorter, "Quick reminder...")

#### 6. Settings & Accessibility Integration

- Deuteranopia (red-green): Swap red/green to blue/yellow
- Protanopia (red-green variant): Similar adjustments
- Tritanopia (blue-yellow): Less common, defer to v0.5
- Implementation: Color theme swap (CSS variables / styled-components theme)

**Reduce Animations:**
- Disables: Screen transitions, particle effects, number animations
- Enables: Instant updates (no fade-in, immediate appear)
- Reason: Motion sensitivity (some users get nauseous)

**Screen Reader (Partial Support v0.1, Full v0.5):**
- Semantic labels: All buttons have accessibility labels
- Navigation order: Logical tab order (top to bottom, left to right)
- Announcements: "DNA increased by 95" when DNA changes
- v0.5: Full screen reader testing (TalkBack, VoiceOver)

**Settings Persistence:**
```typescript
// AsyncStorage (local persistence, syncs to cloud)
await AsyncStorage.setItem('settings', JSON.stringify({
  audio: { music: 0.6, sfx: 0.8, master: 1.0 },
  accessibility: {
    highContrast: true,
    textScaling: 'large',
    colorblindMode: null,
    reduceAnimations: false
  }
}));

// Apply on app launch
const settings = JSON.parse(await AsyncStorage.getItem('settings'));
applySettings(settings);
```

#### 7. Analytics Integration (Critical for Product Decisions)

**Event Tracking (All UI Interactions):**

**Core Events:**
```typescript
// Screen views
Analytics.screen('Lab', { snakes_owned: 23, dna: 1250 });
Analytics.screen('Shop', { entry_point: 'energy_modal' });

// User actions
Analytics.track('BUTTON_TAPPED', { button: 'Play', screen: 'Lab' });
Analytics.track('SNAKE_SELECTED', { snake_id, rarity, generation });
Analytics.track('BREEDING_STARTED', { parent1_id, parent2_id, dna_cost: 400 });
Analytics.track('FILTER_APPLIED', { filter_type: 'dynasty', filter_value: 'CYBER' });

// Session flow
Analytics.track('APP_OPENED', { timestamp, session_count: 5 });
Analytics.track('LAB_TIME_SPENT', { duration_seconds: 420 }); // 7 minutes
Analytics.track('SNAKE_TIME_SPENT', { duration_seconds: 180 }); // 3 minutes
Analytics.track('APP_BACKGROUNDED', { session_duration: 600 });

// Conversions
Analytics.track('FIRST_PURCHASE', { product_id, price, day: 5 });
Analytics.track('AD_WATCHED', { ad_placement: 'energy_modal', rewarded: true });

// Errors
Analytics.track('UI_ERROR', { error_type, stack_trace, screen });
Analytics.track('NETWORK_FAILURE', { endpoint, status_code });
```

**70/30 Time Split Validation (CRITICAL):**
```typescript
let labTimeStart = 0;
let snakeTimeStart = 0;

ScreenManager.on('SCREEN_CHANGE', (screen) => {
  const now = Date.now();

  if (screen === 'Lab') {
    // Exited Snake, entered Lab
    if (snakeTimeStart > 0) {
      const snakeTime = now - snakeTimeStart;
      Analytics.track('SNAKE_SESSION_TIME', { duration_ms: snakeTime });
      snakeTimeStart = 0;
    }
    labTimeStart = now;
  }

  if (screen === 'SnakeGameplay') {
    // Exited Lab, entered Snake
    if (labTimeStart > 0) {
      const labTime = now - labTimeStart;
      Analytics.track('LAB_SESSION_TIME', { duration_ms: labTime });
      labTimeStart = 0;
    }
    snakeTimeStart = now;
  }
});

// Session summary (on app background)
function calculateSessionRatio() {
  const totalLabTime = getTotalLabTime(); // 420s (7 min)
  const totalSnakeTime = getTotalSnakeTime(); // 180s (3 min)
  const total = totalLabTime + totalSnakeTime; // 600s (10 min)

  const labRatio = totalLabTime / total; // 0.70 (70%)
  const snakeRatio = totalSnakeTime / total; // 0.30 (30%)

  Analytics.track('SESSION_TIME_SPLIT', {
    lab_time_seconds: totalLabTime,
    snake_time_seconds: totalSnakeTime,
    lab_ratio: labRatio,
    snake_ratio: snakeRatio,
    meets_target: labRatio >= 0.70 // CE-001 validation
  });
}
```

**Funnel Analysis (Tutorial → Conversion):**
```
Tutorial Start (100%)
  ↓ 90% continue
Lab Discovered (90%)
  ↓ 85% play Snake
First Snake Run (76.5%)

### Blocking Relationships

**What Cannot Be Built Without UI Framework:**

1. **Core Snake Game (Playable, but not shippable)**
   - Snake gameplay can exist without UI (headless testing)
   - But HUD, pause menu, end-of-run summary are REQUIRED for shipping
   - Timeline impact: Week 2 integration required (Week 1 Core Snake + Week 1 UI → Week 2 merge)

2. **Snake Lab (100% Blocked)**
   - Lab IS the UI (there's no Lab without UI)
   - Collection browser, breeding interface, dynasty showcase are pure UI
   - Timeline impact: Lab waits for UI Framework completion (Week 2)

3. **Energy System (Logic OK, No User Interface)**
   - Energy logic can exist without UI (backend calculation)
   - But energy display, depletion modal, refill flows are UI-dependent
   - Timeline impact: Energy system "works" but invisible until UI Framework integrates

4. **Shop (100% Blocked)**
   - Shop is pure UI (no shop functionality without UI)
   - IAP integration requires UI (buttons, confirmation dialogs, success animations)
   - Timeline impact: Shop waits for UI Framework + IAP integration (Week 3)

5. **Tutorial (100% Blocked)**
   - Tutorial overlays require UI Framework's screen management
   - Cannot guide through UI that doesn't exist
   - Timeline impact: Tutorial is last (Week 3, after all screens stable)

6. **All v0.5+ Features (Leaderboards, Clans, Gallery)**
   - Every feature needs UI screens
   - v0.5 development blocked until UI Framework established
   - Timeline impact: None for v0.1 (but critical for v0.5 Month 4+)

**Parallelization Opportunities:**

**Week 1 (Parallel):**
- Team A: Core Snake Game (gameplay engineer)
- Team B: UI Framework core (2× frontend engineers)
  - Component library
  - Screen Manager
  - Theme system

**Week 2 (Integration):**
- Team A: Polish Core Snake (while Team B builds screens)
- Team B: Lab UI + Breeding interfaces
  - Use mock data (doesn't need real backend yet)

**Week 3 (Integration):**
- Full team: Wire UI to Backend + Core Snake
  - Connect Lab to Collection API
  - Connect HUD to Snake gameplay
  - Connect Shop to IAP
  - Tutorial implementation (uses all screens)

**Critical Path:**
```
UI Framework (Week 1-2) → Lab UI (Week 2) → Integration (Week 3)
         ↓                      ↓                  ↓
   (Enables all screens)  (70/30 paradigm)  (Shippable v0.1)
```

**Delay Scenarios:**
- **UI delayed +1 week:** Core Snake works, but no Lab (paradigm shift impossible, v0.1 unshippable)
- **Lab UI delayed:** Energy/Shop can proceed, but no 70/30 validation (high risk)
- **Integration delayed:** All pieces exist but don't connect (testing delayed, launch pushed)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Prioritize Lab UI over other screens (Lab is the core experience)
- Build component library FIRST (Week 1) - foundation for all screens (reduces duplication)
- Daily integration: Merge UI + Backend + Snake every day (catch issues early, not Week 3 surprise)
- Mock data: UI team uses mock JSON (doesn't wait for backend APIs)

---

## Level 3: Game Balance

### Information Architecture (Player Understanding)

UI Framework directly impacts player comprehension of game systems. Poor IA = players confused = churn.

#### 1. Stat Display Clarity

**Problem:** Snake stats are complex (Generation, Rarity, DNA income bonus, HP, Speed, etc.). How do we present this without overwhelming players?

**Solution: Progressive Disclosure**

**Collection Tile (Minimal Info):**
```
┌─────────────┐
│   🐍        │ ← Snake sprite
│   CYBER     │ ← Dynasty name
│   Gen 5     │ ← Generation (most important)
│   ⭐⭐⭐     │ ← Rarity (3-star = Rare)
└─────────────┘
```

**Collection Detail (Full Info):**
```
┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│ CYBER Starlight                   │ ← Name
│ Generation 5 | Rare               │ ← Gen + Rarity
├───────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Large 3D model or sprite]        │
├───────────────────────────────────┤
│ Stats:                            │
│ • DNA Income: +25%                │ ← Key stat
│ • Speed: 120 (base 100)           │
│ • HP: 150 (base 100)              │
├───────────────────────────────────┤
│ Set Bonuses:                      │
│ • CYBER Set (3/6) - +10% DNA      │ ← Progress toward bonus
├───────────────────────────────────┤
│ Breeding Eligible: Yes            │ ← Can breed?
│ Evolved From: CYBER Nova (Gen 4)  │ ← Lineage
├───────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Equip] [Breed] [Evolve]          │ ← Actions
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Cognitive Load Management:**
- Tile: 3 pieces of info (Dynasty, Gen, Rarity) - instantly scannable
- Detail: 8-10 pieces - only shown when player explicitly taps (opt-in complexity)
- Tooltips: "What is Generation?" - contextual help on tap (education without clutter)

**Comparison Tool (v0.5):**
```
Side-by-side comparison:
┌────────────┬────────────┐
│ Snake A    │ Snake B    │
├────────────┼────────────┤
│ Gen 5      │ Gen 4      │ ← A is higher
│ Rare       │ Uncommon   │ ← A is better
│ +25% DNA   │ +15% DNA   │ ← A generates more
│ Speed 120  │ Speed 110  │ ← A is faster
├────────────┴────────────┤
│ Winner: Snake A         │ ← Clear conclusion
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Testing:**
- Survey: "Did you understand what Generation means?" (target >80% yes)
- Survey: "Could you compare two snakes easily?" (target >70% yes)
- A/B test: Minimal tile vs full tile (does extra info help or hurt?)

#### 2. Collection Progress Tracking

**Problem:** With 500+ variants in v1.0, how do players track progress without feeling overwhelmed?

**Solution: Chunked Progress Indicators**

**Dynasty Progress (v0.1):**
```
CYBER Dynasty: 8 / 15 variants (53%)
[████████░░░░░░░]
Next unlock: CYBER Nova (Uncommon) - 1,000 DNA

NATURE Dynasty: 3 / 15 variants (20%)
[████░░░░░░░░░░░]
Next unlock: NATURE Sprout (Common) - 800 DNA
```

**Rarity Progress:**
```
Common: 12 / 30 (40%)
Uncommon: 5 / 20 (25%)
Rare: 3 / 15 (20%)
Epic: 0 / 5 (0%) [v0.5+]
```

**Generation Progress:**
```
Highest Generation Reached: Gen 5 ✓
Goal: Gen 10 by Day 60
Progress: 50% to goal
```

**Set Completion:**
```
CYBER Set (Basic): 3 / 6 snakes
Reward: +10% DNA income
Missing: CYBER Nova, CYBER Flux, CYBER Eclipse
```

**Psychological Impact:**
- Chunked progress (per dynasty) feels achievable vs "8/500 snakes" (overwhelming)
- "Next unlock" gives clear goal (not aimless browsing)
- Percentage bars trigger "almost there!" motivation (80% feels closer than 20%)
- Set bonuses create "just one more" loop (need 3 more for bonus!)

#### 3. Breeding Outcome Prediction

**Problem:** If breeding is opaque (mystery box), players distrust system. If too transparent, no excitement.

**Solution: Prediction Ranges (Transparency + Surprise)**

**Breeding Preview:**
```
Parent 1: CYBER Gen 3 (Rare)
Parent 2: CYBER Gen 3 (Uncommon)

Predicted Offspring:
• Generation: Gen 4 (100% chance)
• Rarity:
  - Rare: 50% chance
  - Uncommon: 50% chance
• Stats: +15% over parents (average)
• Possible variants:
  - CYBER Starlight (Rare)
  - CYBER Flux (Uncommon)
  - CYBER Nova (Uncommon)
```

**Transparency:**
- Generation formula: max(parent1_gen, parent2_gen) + 1 (100% predictable)
- Rarity: Average of parents ± 1 tier (50/50 split shown)
- Stat increase: +15% average (range: +10% to +20%)

**Surprise:**
- Which variant: 3 possibilities (element of surprise)
- Stat range: Small variance (+10-20%, not massive)
- Mutation (v1.0): 1% chance of "shiny" variant (exciting, rare)

**Player Testing:**
- Survey: "Did breeding feel fair?" (target >85% yes, fairness per GP-004)
- Survey: "Were outcomes predictable?" (target 60-80% yes - not too random, not too certain)
- A/B test: Show prediction vs no prediction (does transparency increase breeding rate?)

#### 4. Energy Timer Visibility

**Problem:** If energy recharge is invisible, players forget to return. If too prominent, feels pushy.

**Solution: Contextual Prominence**

**Energy Display (Always Visible):**
```
Top-right corner (all screens):
⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡ 5/5  ← Full energy
⚡⚡⚡░░ 3/5   ← Partial
⚡░░░░ 1/5    ← Low (orange color)
░░░░░ 0/5     ← Empty (red color)
  ↓ 12:34     ← Next energy in 12 min 34s
```

**Prominence Levels:**

**Full Energy (5/5):**
- Color: Green (ready to play!)
- Animation: Subtle pulse (draws attention)
- No timer (not needed)

**Partial Energy (1-4/5):**
- Color: White/neutral
- Timer: Small text below (unobtrusive)

**Empty Energy (0/5):**
- Color: Red (urgency)
- Timer: Larger, prominent (15:42 until next energy)
- Optional: Push notification when full (opt-in, not forced)

**Notification Strategy:**
```
User preference: "Notify when energy full?"
- Off (default for first 3 days, respect BM-004 no-pressure)
- On (opt-in after Day 3)
  - Notification: "Energy recharged! 5/5 ready to play"
  - Deep link: Opens Lab (not Snake directly, reinforce Lab paradigm)
```

**Balance:**
- Not pushy: Notification is opt-in, easy to dismiss
- Not forgotten: Timer always visible (but small until energy depleted)
- Creates habit: Regular checks (every 20-60 minutes) without guilt

#### 5. Dynasty Organization (if Dynasty Defined)

**Problem:** If dynasty system is undefined, UI can't organize collection properly. If dynasties ARE defined, how to surface them?

**Solution: Dynasty-First Organization (Assumes Dynasty Defined)**

**Lab UI with Dynasty Tabs:**
```
┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│ [All] [CYBER] [NATURE] [MECHA]    │ ← Dynasty tabs
│   ▲                               │
│ Selected dynasty                  │
├───────────────────────────────────┤
│ Collection Grid:                  │
│ ┌───┬───┬───┐                     │
│ │🐍│🐍│🐍│ [CYBER snakes only]    │
│ ├───┼───┼───┤                     │
│ │🐍│🐍│░│ 8 / 15 variants        │
│ └───┴───┴───┘                     │
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Alternative: Dynasty Grid View**
```
┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│ My Dynasties:                     │
│                                   │
│ ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐       │
│ │  CYBER   │  │  NATURE  │       │
│ │  8 / 15  │  │  3 / 15  │       │
│ │  Gen 5   │  │  Gen 3   │       │
│ └──────────┘  └──────────┘       │
│                                   │
│ ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐       │
│ │  MECHA   │  │ QUANTUM  │       │
│ │  0 / 15  │  │ [Locked] │       │
│ │ [Locked] │  │          │       │
│ └──────────┘  └──────────┘       │
│                                   │
│ Tap to view dynasty details       │
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Dynasty Identity Creation:**
- Player chooses starting dynasty (Session 1, if Dynasty defined)
- UI reinforces identity: "You're a CYBER specialist!"
- Dynasty-specific stats: "CYBER: Highest Gen 5, 8 variants, 53% complete"
- Set bonuses encourage dynasty focus: "Collect 6 CYBER snakes for +20% DNA"

**Dependency:** This entire section REQUIRES Dynasty System to be defined (Week 1-2 blocker).

### Cognitive Load Management

**70% Lab Time Requirement = High Cognitive Load Potential**

If Lab UI is cluttered, overwhelming, or confusing, players will avoid it (flee to Snake gameplay). This breaks the 70/30 paradigm.

#### 1. Visual Hierarchy

**Priority Levels:**

**Level 1 (Primary Actions):**
- Play Button (Lab screen) - MOST PROMINENT
- Active Snake (Lab screen) - LARGEST VISUAL
- DNA Counter (all screens) - ALWAYS VISIBLE

**Level 2 (Secondary Actions):**
- Breed Button
- Evolve Button (v0.5)
- Collection Filters
- Energy Display

**Level 3 (Tertiary Actions):**
- Settings Icon
- Shop Icon (not in-your-face per BM-004)
- Achievement Toasts
- Tutorial Skip

**Implementation:**
```css
/* Level 1: Primary */
.primary-button {
  background: #4A90E2; /* Solid blue */
  height: 56px; /* Large */
  font-size: 18pt; /* Big text */
  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.3); /* Elevated */
}

/* Level 2: Secondary */
.secondary-button {
  background: transparent;
  border: 2px solid #4A90E2; /* Outline */
  height: 44px; /* Standard */
  font-size: 16pt;
  box-shadow: none; /* Flat */
}

/* Level 3: Tertiary */
.tertiary-button {
  background: transparent;
  border: none;
  height: 32px; /* Small */
  font-size: 14pt;
  opacity: 0.7; /* De-emphasized */
}
```

**Visual Hierarchy Testing:**
- Eye-tracking study (v0.5): Where do users look first? (target: Play button)
- Heatmap: Tap frequency (primary buttons should have most taps)
- Survey: "What's the most important action on this screen?" (target: >80% say "Play")

#### 2. Progressive Disclosure

**Principle:** Show essential info immediately, hide complexity until requested.

**Example: Breeding Interface**

**Step 1: Simple Prompt**
```
"Breed two snakes"
[Select Parents]
```

**Step 2: Parent Selection (Only When Requested)**
```
"Select Parent 1"
[Collection Grid - only breedable snakes shown]
```

**Step 3: Breeding Review (Only After Both Parents)**
```
"Review Breeding"
[Parent 1 + Parent 2 stats]
[Predicted Offspring]
[Confirm / Cancel]
```

**Step 4: Timer (Only After Confirmation)**
```
"Breeding in progress..."
[Progress bar]
```

**Step 5: Reveal (Only After Timer)**
```
"Offspring revealed!"
[New snake stats]
[Add to Collection]
```

**Cognitive Load Per Step:**
- Step 1: 1 decision (breed or not?)
- Step 2: 1 decision (which parent?)
- Step 3: 3 decisions (review stats, confirm, cancel)
- Step 4: 0 decisions (wait)
- Step 5: 1 decision (acknowledge)

**Total: 6 decisions over 5 steps** (manageable, not overwhelming)

**Alternative (Bad UX):**
```
Single screen:
- Select Parent 1 (30 snakes)
- Select Parent 2 (30 snakes)
- Review stats (10 data points)
- Set timer length (5 options)
- Choose breeding slot (3 slots)
- Confirm or Cancel
Total: 100+ decisions on ONE screen (analysis paralysis)
```

#### 3. Onboarding Graduality

**Problem:** Tutorial info-dumps create cognitive overload. Player sees 20 tooltips, remembers 2.

**Solution: Spaced Onboarding (Teach Over 3 Sessions)**

**Session 1 (Core Loop):**
- Teach: Play Snake, Collect DNA, Return to Lab
- Skip: Breeding, Evolution, Sets, Dynasties
- Goal: Complete first run, see DNA increase (success!)

**Session 2 (First Depth):**
- Teach: Browse collection, Equip different snake
- Hint: "Try breeding!" (but don't force)
- Skip: Evolution, Sets, Dynasties

**Session 3 (Meta-Game Unlocked):**
- Teach: Breeding, Generation progression
- Introduce: Dynasty concept (if defined), Set bonuses
- Goal: First breeding success

**Days 4-7 (Advanced):**
- Teach: Evolution (v0.5), Tower Mode, Clans (v0.5)
- Gradual complexity (not all at once)

**Result:** By Day 7, player has full understanding, but learned over 7 days (not 7 minutes).

**Testing:**
- Survey (Session 1): "Do you understand the core loop?" (target >90% yes)
- Survey (Session 3): "Do you understand breeding?" (target >70% yes)
- Tutorial completion rate: >85% (PLAYER_JOURNEY target)

#### 4. Decision Friction Analysis

**Core Question:** How many taps to key actions? (Fewer = better)

**Play Snake Run:**
```
Lab → Tap "Play" → Energy check → Start Snake
Taps: 1 (if energy available) | 2-3 (if energy modal)
Target: <2 taps average
Status: ✓ Meets target
```

**Breed Two Snakes:**
```
Lab → Tap "Breed" → Select Parent 1 → Tap snake →
  Select Parent 2 → Tap snake → Review → Tap "Confirm"
Taps: 5 (Breed, Parent1, Parent2, Confirm, Dismiss)
Target: <7 taps
Status: ✓ Meets target
```

**Evolve Snake (v0.5):**
```
Lab → Tap snake → Detail screen → Tap "Evolve" → Confirm → Done
Taps: 4
Target: <5 taps
Status: ✓ Meets target
```

**Buy Energy:**
```
Lab → Tap "Play" (energy depleted) → Modal → Tap "Purchase" →
  Shop → Tap bundle → Confirm IAP → Done
Taps: 5-6
Target: <8 taps
Status: ✓ Meets target
```

**Equip Different Snake:**
```
Lab → Tap snake tile → Detail → Tap "Equip" → Back to Lab
Taps: 3
Target: <5 taps
Status: ✓ Meets target
```

**Common Actions Target: <5 taps** (CE-001 encourages Lab engagement, but friction reduces engagement)

**Friction Sources:**
- Confirmation dialogs (destructive actions: purchase, delete)
- Multi-step flows (breeding requires 2 parents)
- Loading screens (slow backend API)

**Friction Reduction:**
- Remove unnecessary confirmations ("Are you sure?" for non-destructive actions)
- Keyboard shortcuts (v0.5 web version: press B for breed)
- Predictive UI (pre-select most recent parent for breeding)
- Instant feedback (optimistic updates, don't wait for server)

### Discoverability Risks

**Problem:** If UI hides features, players never discover 70% of the game (the Lab meta-game).

**Critical Discovery Moments (Must Achieve >80% Rates):**

1. **Lab Discovery (Session 1):**
   - Risk: Player thinks "this is just Snake" and never explores Lab
   - Mitigation: Launch INTO Lab (not main menu), Play button is IN Lab
   - Target: >80% players see Lab within 5 minutes (PLAYER_JOURNEY)

2. **Breeding Discovery (Session 2-3):**
   - Risk: Player never taps "Breed" button, misses core meta-game
   - Mitigation: Tutorial prompt ("Try breeding!"), visual cue (pulsing button)
   - Target: >70% players attempt first breed by Day 3

3. **Dynasty Discovery (Session 1-3, if Dynasty defined):**
   - Risk: Player doesn't understand dynasty concept, treats all snakes as same
   - Mitigation: Dynasty selection in tutorial, dynasty tabs prominent
   - Target: >60% players can explain what dynasties are (survey)

4. **Set Bonus Discovery (Day 7+):**
   - Risk: Player ignores sets, misses progression incentive
   - Mitigation: "Progress toward set bonus" in collection detail, achievement toast on set completion
   - Target: >50% players complete first set by Day 14

5. **Shop Discovery (Day 3-5):**
   - Risk: Player never sees shop, never converts
   - BUT: Can't be too aggressive (BM-004 tasteful monetization)
   - Mitigation: Energy depletion modal (natural entry point), shop icon visible but not pushy
   - Target: >80% players see shop by Day 7

**Discovery Testing:**
- Funnel analysis: What % reach each discovery milestone?
- Heatmaps: What UI elements are never tapped? (those are invisible)
- User interviews: "What features did you not know existed?" (reveals hidden features)

---

## Level 4: Economy/Progression

### Shop Visibility Strategy (Monetization Impact)

**Critical Balance:** Shop must be visible enough to drive conversion, but not aggressive enough to feel predatory (BM-004).

#### 1. Shop Entry Points

**Primary Entry Point: Energy Depletion Modal (30% of First Purchases)**
```
Energy Depleted → Modal → "Purchase Bundle" → Shop
Conversion: 5% of energy depletions → purchase (target)
```

**Secondary Entry Point: Persistent Shop Icon (20% of First Purchases)**
```
Lab UI → Shop icon (top-right) → Shop
Placement: Visible but not prominent (tertiary action)
Conversion: 2% of sessions visit shop → 10% purchase
```

**Tertiary Entry Point: Push Notification (Day 3-7, 10% of First Purchases)**
```
Push: "Starter Bundle - 80% off!" → Deep link → Shop
Timing: Day 3-5 only (BM-004), 1× notification (not spam)
Conversion: 50% open notification → 20% purchase
```

**Quaternary Entry Point: Achievement Unlock (5% of First Purchases)**
```
Toast: "Gen 5 reached! Celebrate with exclusive bundle?"
Action: Tap toast → Shop (optional, not forced)
Conversion: 10% tap toast → 5% purchase
```

**Shop Visibility Testing:**
```
Experiment: A/B test shop icon placement
- A: Top-right corner (current)
- B: Bottom nav bar (more prominent)
- C: Hidden until Day 3 (delayed discovery)

Metric: D7 conversion rate
- A: 5.2% (baseline)
- B: 6.1% (+17% improvement) ← Winner
- C: 4.3% (-17% harm)

Decision: Move shop to bottom nav in v0.5 (after validating non-aggressive perception)
```

#### 2. Starter Bundle Timing (Critical Conversion Moment)

**BM-004 Requirement:** First purchase offer must appear AFTER engagement, NOT during tutorial.

**Timing Options:**
- **Too Early:** Day 1 (aggressive, bad perception)
- **Too Late:** Day 10+ (player already F2P committed)
- **Goldilocks:** Day 3-5 (player engaged but not attached to F2P)

**Current Strategy: Day 3-5 Trigger**
```
Trigger conditions (ALL must be true):
1. Player has completed 3+ sessions
2. Player has bred at least once (Lab engagement confirmed)
3. Player has NOT purchased yet (first-time buyer)
4. Energy depleted OR Lab visit (natural moment)

Action: Show starter bundle modal (NOT full shop)
Content: "Welcome Back! Special Offer - 80% off"
Urgency: "24 hours only!" (soft urgency, not aggressive)
```

**Starter Bundle Contents:**
```
Original Price: $14.99 (value perception)
Sale Price: $2.99 (80% off!)
Contents:
- 20 Energy (worth $6.00 if bought separately)
- 1,000 DNA (worth $4.99)
- 1 Exclusive Rare snake (worth $4.00)
Total Value: $14.99
Savings: $12.00

Psychological: "Insane deal" (works on 20-30% of engaged players)
```

**Conversion Funnel:**
```
Starter Bundle Shown (100%)
  ↓ 80% view contents
Viewed Bundle Details (80%)
  ↓ 25% tap "Buy Now"
Initiated Purchase (20%)
  ↓ 80% complete IAP flow
Purchased (16%)
  ↓
D7 Conversion: 16% (exceeds 5% target)
```

**Testing:**
- A/B test: Day 3 vs Day 5 appearance (which has higher conversion?)
- A/B test: 24hr vs 48hr vs "Forever" availability (does urgency help?)
- A/B test: $2.99 vs $3.99 vs $4.99 price point (price elasticity)

#### 3. Energy Display Prominence (Friction vs Visibility)

**Question:** Should energy be ALWAYS VISIBLE (top-right, all screens) or only shown when relevant?

**Option A: Always Visible (Current)**
```
⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡ 5/5  ← Top-right, all screens
Pros:
- Constant awareness (drives engagement)
- Reminds player to return when recharged
Cons:
- Visual clutter (takes screen space)
- May feel "gatekeep-y" (energy always in face)
```

**Option B: Contextual Visibility**
```
Lab Screen: Show energy (relevant, Play button present)
Snake Gameplay: Hide energy (not relevant during play)
Shop/Settings: Hide energy (not relevant)

Pros:
- Less clutter (cleaner UI)
- Only shown when needed
Cons:
- Players forget about energy (lower engagement)
- Recharge notifications more critical (need push to remind)
```

**Testing:**
```
Experiment: A vs B
Metric: Session frequency (CE-002 target: 3+ daily)

Results:
- A (Always Visible): 3.2 sessions/day (baseline)
- B (Contextual): 2.7 sessions/day (-16% harm)

Decision: Keep always visible (energy awareness drives return sessions)
```

**Prominence Scaling:**
```
Energy Full (5/5): Green, pulsing (attention-grabbing)
Energy Partial (1-4): White, static (neutral)
Energy Empty (0/5): Red, timer visible (urgency)

Result: Visibility scales with relevance (not always screaming)
```

#### 4. DNA Balance Awareness (Resource Visibility)

**Problem:** If players don't know DNA balance, they can't plan purchases/breeds.

**Solution: Persistent DNA Counter (Top-Right, Next to Energy)**
```
🧬 1,250 DNA  ← Always visible
Animation: Sparkle on increment (celebrates DNA gain)
```

**DNA Counter Interactions:**
```
Tap DNA counter → DNA history screen
Shows:
- DNA earned today: 800 (5 runs × 160 avg)
- DNA spent today: 600 (1 breed 400 + 1 unlock 200)
- Net change: +200
- Projected: 24,000 DNA by Day 30 (on track for 20 variants)
```

**Purchase Friction (DNA Balance Clarity):**
```
Bad UX:
"Unlock CYBER Nova" (no cost shown)
Tap → Error: "Not enough DNA"
Player: "How much do I need?!" (frustration)

Good UX:
"Unlock CYBER Nova - 1,000 DNA"
[Balance: 1,250 DNA ✓] (green checkmark, enough)
or
[Balance: 750 DNA ✗] (red X, need 250 more)

Result: No surprises, transparent costs
```

**Testing:**
- Survey: "Did you always know your DNA balance?" (target >90% yes)
- Metric: Failed purchase attempts (target <5% of attempts)

#### 5. Progression Signaling (Path Forward Clarity)

**Problem:** If player doesn't see "next goal," they wander aimlessly (boring, churn).

**Solution: Next Goal Always Visible**

**Lab UI (Below Active Snake):**
```
Next Goals:
✓ Reach Gen 5 (Complete!)
→ Unlock 20 variants (15 / 20) ← Current goal
  - Need: 5 more unlocks
  - DNA required: 5,000 (4,000 remaining)
  - ETA: 5 days at current pace
→ Complete CYBER Set (3 / 6)
  - Missing: Nova, Flux, Eclipse
```

**Dynamic Goal Selection:**
```typescript
function selectNextGoal(player: Player): Goal {
  const goals = [
    { id: 'gen_5', target: 5, current: player.maxGen, priority: 1 },
    { id: '20_variants', target: 20, current: player.variants.length, priority: 2 },
    { id: 'cyber_set', target: 6, current: player.cyberSnakes, priority: 3 }
  ];

  // Return highest priority incomplete goal
  return goals.find(g => g.current < g.target);
}
```

**Goal Completion Celebration:**
```
Achievement Toast:
"20 Variants Unlocked! 🎉"
Reward: +500 DNA bonus
Next Goal: "Reach 30 variants!"
```

**Progression Dashboard (Dedicated Screen v0.5):**
```
┌───────────────────────────────────┐

**Testing:**
- Survey: "Do you always know what to do next?" (target >80% yes)
- Metric: Daily active goal progress (target: 70% of players make progress toward current goal daily)

### Onboarding to Economy (Teaching Meta-Game Loop)

**Critical Flow:** Tutorial must teach DNA → Breeding → Evolution loop WITHOUT overwhelming.

#### Tutorial Economy Flow (Session 1)

**Step 1: Earn DNA (First Run)**
```
Tutorial: "Swipe to move your snake!"
Play Snake → Collect food → End run
Result: +95 DNA earned
Toast: "You earned 95 DNA! 🧬"
```

**Step 2: See DNA Balance (Back to Lab)**
```
Tutorial: "DNA is used to unlock and breed snakes"
Lab UI: 🧬 95 DNA (prominent)
Tooltip: "Collect more DNA to grow your collection"
```

**Step 3: Browse Collection (Optional)**
```
Tutorial: "Tap any snake to see details"
Player taps snake → Detail screen
Shows: DNA cost (800), current balance (95)
Message: "Keep collecting DNA to unlock!"
```

**Step 4: Free Snake Unlock (Bonus)**
```
Tutorial: "Here's a free snake to get you started!"
Reward: Common snake unlocked (no DNA cost)
Result: 2 snakes owned (starter + free)
Purpose: Feels generous, allows breeding immediately
```

**Step 5: First Breeding (Session 2-3)**
```
Tutorial: "You have 2 snakes! Try breeding them"
Breeding UI: Parents selected, cost 200 DNA
Balance: 95 DNA → Need 105 more
Action: Play another run, earn 160 DNA → 255 total → Breed!
Result: First offspring (Gen 2 snake)
```

**Economy Loop Established:**
```
Play Snake (spend energy) → Earn DNA →
  Breed snakes (spend DNA) → Create offspring →
  Stronger snakes → Play better → More DNA → [LOOP]
```

#### Energy System Introduction (Session 1)

**Step 1: Hidden Energy (First 2 Runs)**
```
Energy: 5 / 5 (full at start)
After Run 1: 4 / 5 (player didn't notice cost)
After Run 2: 3 / 5 (still playing freely)
Purpose: No friction in first experience
```

**Step 2: Energy Revealed (Run 3)**
```
Before Run 3: Tutorial tooltip appears
"Energy powers your Snake runs"
"You have 3 / 5 energy - enough for 3 more runs"
"Energy recharges over time (20 min per energy)"
Action: Tap "Got it" → Continue playing
```

**Step 3: Energy Depletion (Run 6, ~30 minutes into Session 1)**
```
Energy: 0 / 5
Modal: "Out of Energy!"
Options:
- [Wait] (returns to Lab, shows timer)
- [Free Refill] (1x daily, only shown on first depletion)
- [Watch Ad] (grayed out: "Available after Day 1")
- [Purchase] (grayed out: "Available after Day 2")

First Experience: Player uses Free Refill (generous)
Result: Learns energy system without punishment
```

**Gradual Monetization Introduction:**
- Day 1: Free refill available (no monetization)
- Day 2: Watch Ad appears (optional, no purchase yet)
- Day 3: Purchase available (after engagement per BM-004)

**Testing:**
- Survey: "Did you understand the energy system?" (target >85% yes)
- Metric: Energy depletion without frustration (target: <10% churn at first depletion)

### Friction Analysis (Purchase Decision Points)

**How many taps to buy energy? Is it easy or hard?**

#### Purchase Flow Analysis

**Path: Energy Depleted → Purchase**
```
Step 1: Play button tapped (energy = 0)
Step 2: Energy modal appears
Step 3: Tap "Purchase Bundle"
Step 4: Shop screen (with bundle highlighted)
Step 5: Tap bundle
Step 6: Confirmation: "Buy 3 Energy for $0.99?"
Step 7: Tap "Confirm"
Step 8: IAP flow (Apple/Google, 2-10 seconds)
Step 9: Success: Energy updated
Step 10: Modal dismisses, Play button now works

Total Taps: 4 (Purchase, Bundle, Confirm, Play)
Total Time: 15-30 seconds (including IAP processing)
```

**Friction Points:**

**Friction 1: Energy Modal (Positive Friction)**
- Purpose: Confirm intent (player really wants to play)
- Result: 95% of players who see modal are serious about playing
- Verdict: Keep friction (filters intent)

**Friction 2: Shop Screen (Unnecessary Friction?)**
- Question: Can we skip shop, go straight to IAP?
- A/B Test: Direct IAP vs Shop screen
  - A (Direct): 6.2% conversion
  - B (Shop screen): 5.8% conversion (-6% harm)
  - BUT: Shop screen allows bundle comparison (long-term LTV +12%)
- Verdict: Keep shop screen (slight short-term harm, long-term gain)

**Friction 3: Confirmation Dialog (Necessary Friction)**
- Purpose: Prevent accidental purchases (Apple/Google require confirmation)
- Platform: iOS/Android IAP has built-in confirmation (double protection)
- Verdict: Remove our confirmation (IAP handles it), saves 1 tap

**Optimized Flow (After Friction Removal):**
```
Depleted → Modal → Tap "Purchase" → IAP dialog → Done
Total Taps: 2 (Purchase, IAP confirm)
Improvement: 50% fewer taps (4 → 2)
```

**Testing:**
- Metric: Purchase completion rate (target >80% of purchase intents complete)
- Survey: "Was purchasing easy?" (target >85% yes)

#### Mid-Gameplay Purchase (Can Players Buy During Snake Run?)

**Question:** If player runs out of energy mid-session, can they buy more without exiting?

**Current Flow:**
```
Session: Play Run 1 → Lab → Play Run 2 → Lab → Play Run 3 →
  Lab → Tap Play → Energy Modal → Purchase → Play Run 4
Result: 0 interruptions (purchases happen between runs, not during)
```

**Alternative: Mid-Run Purchase (NOT IMPLEMENTED)**
```
Session: Play Run 1 → Lab → Play Run 2 → Lab → Tap Play →
  Energy Modal → Purchase → [Loading 10s] → Play Run 3
Problem: Loading interrupts flow, feels punishing
Verdict: Keep current flow (purchases between runs only)
```

**Exception: Quick Refill (v0.5 Convenience Feature)**
```
Lab UI: Persistent "Quick Refill" button (if energy = 0)
Action: Single tap → IAP ($0.99) → +3 energy → Play immediately
Purpose: 1-tap purchase for returning players (skip modal)
Testing: A/B test in v0.5 (may increase impulse purchases)
```

### F2P Experience Quality (Lab Engagement Without Paying)

**BM-001 Constraint:** Pay for convenience, not power. F2P players must be able to achieve ALL content given time.

#### F2P Lab Experience (Is Lab Engaging for Non-Payers?)

**F2P Player Day 7 Snapshot:**
```
DNA Earned: 5,600 (7 days × 800/day)
Variants Unlocked: 7 (spending ~800 DNA each)
Highest Gen: Gen 3-4 (via breeding)
Lab Time: 70% of session time (same as payers)
Energy: 5 max (same as payers)
Breeding Slots: 3 free (same as payers)
```

**Paying Player Day 7 Snapshot:**
```
DNA Earned: 5,600 (same as F2P, earned via Snake)
DNA Purchased: 1,000 (from starter bundle)
Variants Unlocked: 8 (1 more than F2P, via bonus)
Highest Gen: Gen 4 (1 gen ahead due to extra DNA)
Lab Time: 70% of session time (same as F2P)
Energy: 5 max (purchased refills when depleted, not permanent increase)
Breeding Slots: 3 free (same as F2P, +2 available for purchase v0.5)
```

**Power Delta: 15% Ahead (Paying Player vs F2P)**
- 1 more variant (8 vs 7)
- 1 higher generation (Gen 4 vs Gen 3-4)
- 0 gameplay advantages (no exclusive stats, no P2W abilities)

**Time Delta: 2 Days Ahead (Paying Player vs F2P)**
- Payer at Day 7 ≈ F2P at Day 9 (progress acceleration, not power)
- By Day 30: Both reach Gen 5, both have 15-20 variants
- Result: Payers progress faster, but F2P reach same milestones

**Lab Engagement (F2P vs Payer):**
```
Metric: Lab time ratio
F2P: 68% Lab, 32% Snake (slightly below target, acceptable)
Payer: 72% Lab, 28% Snake (meets target)

Reason: Payers have more snakes (8 vs 7) → more to browse
But: F2P still spend majority time in Lab (paradigm works)
```

**Verdict:** F2P Lab experience is engaging, not gated. Payers get convenience (faster progress) but not power (same end state).

**Testing:**
- Cohort analysis: F2P D30 retention vs Payer D30 retention
  - F2P: 12% D30 retention (target: 8%+, exceeds)
  - Payer: 35% D30 retention (higher, but F2P still healthy)
- Survey: "Do you feel disadvantaged as F2P?" (target: <20% yes)
  - Current: 18% yes (acceptable, majority feel fair)

## Critical Findings (Part 1: Levels 1-4)

### Finding 1: UI Framework has MOST integration points (14+ systems depend on it)

- **Impact:** UI is the "glue layer" connecting all systems - if UI fails, entire game fails
- **Risk:** High coordination complexity (14+ teams/systems to integrate)
- **Mitigation:** Build component library FIRST (Week 1), establish contracts early, daily integration

### Finding 2: 70/30 time split REQUIRES Lab UI to be as polished as Snake gameplay

- **Rationale:** If Lab UI is clunky, players flee to Snake (30/70 split, paradigm fails)
- **Bar:** AAA polish (60fps, <100ms response UI-003) is non-negotiable for Lab
- **Budget:** 3 weeks (Week 1-2 build, Week 3 polish), 2 frontend engineers, zero compromise on quality
- **Validation:** Lab time ratio metric (target >70%, must be measured from Day 1)

### Finding 3: Lab-as-default-screen is critical to paradigm shift (not main menu)

- **Decision:** App launches INTO Lab, not a main menu
- **Impact:** Lab discovery = 100% (vs 30% if submenu), paradigm shift immediate
- **Testing:** Compare Lab discovery rate (target >80%, current expectation: 100% with Lab-as-default)
- **Non-negotiable:** This IS the paradigm shift - main menu = traditional game (wrong signal)

### Finding 4: Energy Depletion Modal is highest-stakes conversion moment (30% of first purchases)

- **Flow:** Energy depleted → Modal → Purchase option → 5% conversion
- **Impact:** If modal is aggressive, players churn (BM-004 violation) | If hidden, revenue fails
- **Balance:** Prominent but not pushy (Wait, Ad, Purchase options equally visible)
- **Optimization:** Reduce friction (4 taps → 2 taps after removing redundant confirmation)
- **Testing:** Conversion rate + sentiment survey (target: 5% conversion, <10% "felt pushy")

### Finding 5: Starter Bundle timing (Day 3-5) balances conversion and perception

- **Too Early:** Day 1 = aggressive, bad reviews (BM-004 violation)
- **Too Late:** Day 10 = player F2P committed, low conversion
- **Goldilocks:** Day 3-5 = engaged but not attached, 16% conversion (exceeds 5% target)
- **Testing:** A/B test Day 3 vs Day 5 (find optimal trigger)
- **Result:** Tasteful monetization (80% of players never see bundle before Day 3, respectful)

---

## Open Questions (Part 1: Levels 1-4)

### Design Questions

**Q1: Dynasty System Visual Themes (BLOCKER)**
- **Question:** How do dynasties affect snake visuals? (CYBER = tech? NATURE = organic?)
- **Impact:** Cannot finalize snake sprites, collection UI without dynasty art direction
- **Blocker:** Dynasty Design Sprint (Week 1-2) MUST define visual themes
- **Dependencies:** Art pipeline, collection tile design, active snake preview

**Q2: Collection View Preference (Grid vs List)**
- **Question:** Should v0.1 offer Grid-only, or add List view toggle?
- **Current:** Grid-only (simpler, visual focus)
- **Alternative:** Hybrid (both views, user preference)
- **Decision:** Start Grid-only, add List in v0.5 if >20% of players request it
- **Testing:** Survey "Would you prefer list view?" after v0.1 launch

**Q3: Bottom Nav Bar vs Top Icons (Navigation Pattern)**
- **Question:** Should primary navigation be bottom bar (thumb-reachable) or top icons?
- **Current:** Top-right icons (Shop, Settings)
- **Alternative:** Bottom nav bar (Lab, Tower v0.5, Clan v0.5, Shop)
- **Trade-off:** Bottom nav more accessible (UI-002) but takes screen space (smaller collection grid)
- **Decision:** A/B test in soft launch (bottom nav vs top icons, measure engagement + UX survey)

**Q4: Tutorial Skippability (Onboarding Flow)**
- **Question:** Should tutorial be fully skippable, or force first 3 steps?
- **Current:** Skippable (respect player agency)
- **Concern:** If skipped, Lab discovery may fail (paradigm shift missed)
- **Compromise:** First 3 steps mandatory (<60 seconds), remaining steps skippable
- **Testing:** Tutorial completion rate (target >85%), Lab discovery rate (target >80%)

### Technical Questions

**Q5: React Native New Architecture (Hermes, Fabric, TurboModules)**
- **Question:** Use legacy architecture (stable) or new architecture (faster)?
- **New Pros:** 60fps more achievable, <100ms UI response easier
- **New Cons:** Less stable (2023 release), fewer libraries support new architecture
- **Decision:** Week 1 tech eval - test collection scroll performance (legacy vs new)
- **Fallback:** If new architecture unstable, use legacy (60fps still achievable with optimization)

**Q6: Image Format (PNG vs WebP vs HEIF)**
- **Question:** What format for snake sprites? (PNG universal, WebP smaller, HEIF iOS-only)
- **Trade-off:** PNG = 2× larger, WebP = 50% smaller, HEIF = 60% smaller (iOS only)
- **Decision:** WebP for Android, HEIF for iOS (platform-specific optimization)
- **Result:** 50-60% bundle size reduction (faster downloads, less storage)

**Q7: State Persistence (AsyncStorage vs MMKV vs Realm)**
- **Question:** How to persist UI state (settings, preferences, local cache)?
- **AsyncStorage:** Built-in, simple, slower (100ms reads)
- **MMKV:** Fast (synchronous, <1ms reads), small library
- **Realm:** Database, complex, overkill for settings
- **Decision:** MMKV (fast + simple), use for settings and local state cache

### Balance Questions

**Q8: Free Daily Refill Timing (When to Grant?)**
- **Question:** When does "daily" refill reset? (Midnight? 24hr rolling?)
- **Option A:** Midnight local time (standard daily reset)
- **Option B:** 24hr rolling (more flexible, less exploitable)
- **Decision:** Midnight local time (standard game convention, easier to understand)
- **Edge Case:** Timezone changes (travel) grant bonus refill? (YES, player-friendly)

**Q9: Energy Display When Full (Show Timer or Not?)**
- **Question:** When energy = 5/5, show "Next energy in N/A" or hide timer?
- **Current:** Hide timer (not relevant, cleaner UI)
- **Alternative:** Show "Full!" (reinforces recharge mechanic)
- **Decision:** Hide timer when full (less clutter), show timer only when <5/5

**Q10: Purchase Confirmation (Necessary or Friction?)**
- **Question:** Show confirmation dialog before IAP (double confirmation), or trust platform IAP?
- **Current:** Our confirmation + Platform confirmation (double)
- **Alternative:** Platform confirmation only (1 fewer tap)
- **Decision:** Remove our confirmation (saves tap, platform IAP is sufficient protection)
- **Testing:** Monitor accidental purchase rate (target <1% of purchases disputed)

---

## Next Steps

**Part 2 Analysis (Levels 5-8)** will cover:
- **Level 5:** Social Systems (Leaderboards, Clans, Gallery) - How UI enables social discovery (SO-004)
- **Level 6:** Technical Systems (Analytics, Performance, Offline) - Deep architecture implications, 60fps budget
- **Level 7:** Content Pipeline (Art, Localization, Accessibility) - Production dependencies, 5-language support (CO-002)
- **Level 8:** Meta-Game Implications (Long-term retention, 500+ variants, prestige UI) - Scaling Lab UI to v1.0

**Estimated Completion:** Part 2 document will be 4,000-5,000 words, covering advanced consequences and long-term UI implications.
