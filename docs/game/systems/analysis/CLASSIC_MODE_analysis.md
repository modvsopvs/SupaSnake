# Classic Mode: Complete 8-Level Consequence Analysis

**System:** Classic Mode (The DNA Mine)
**Tier:** Tier 1 (Core Loop)
**Status:** Primary gameplay mode - Resource mining
**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-14
**Word Count:** ~5,800 words

---

## System Overview

### Purpose and Identity

Classic Mode is SupaSnake's **primary gameplay mode** - the "DNA mine" that provides predictable, relaxing resource generation for daily Lab progression. This is not a test of endurance or skill ceiling - it's a **5-minute focused collection session** that transforms Snake gameplay into steady economic output.

**Core Identity:**
- **The Daily Grind (Positive):** Comfortable, predictable DNA farming
- **Not Challenging:** Easier than Tower Mode, accessible to all skill levels
- **Relaxing Experience:** Low-stress gameplay, not adrenaline-pumping
- **Primary Activity:** 80%+ of all Snake runs occur in Classic Mode
- **Resource Mining:** Players think "I need DNA" → Classic Mode is the answer

**Economic Role:**
From MVP_VISION.md:
> ### 1. Classic Mode - The DNA Mine
> - **Purpose**: Predictable resource generation for daily Lab experiments
> - **Session Length**: 5 minutes of focused collection
> - **Rewards**: Base DNA strands, common evolution materials
> - **Experience**: Relaxing gameplay providing steady progression

### Critical Constraints

**CE-001: 30% Time Allocation**
- Players spend 30% of session time playing Snake
- Classic Mode is the PRIMARY Snake activity (80%+ of runs)
- Must generate sufficient DNA to sustain 70% Lab engagement
- 5-minute sessions fit into 15-minute total sessions perfectly

**CE-002: Session Frequency (3+ sessions/day)**
- Energy recharges every 20 minutes
- 5 energy max = 5 Classic runs over ~2 hours
- Creates natural return triggers throughout day
- Morning run → Lunch run → Evening run pattern

**CE-004: Retention Targets**
- D1 retention: 50%+ (Classic must hook players immediately)
- D7 retention: 25%+ (Classic must remain engaging for week 1)
- D30 retention: 15%+ (Classic must not feel like grind by Day 30)

**BM-004: Playing is Resource Mining**
- Classic Mode validates the paradigm shift
- "I'm not playing Snake for fun, I'm mining DNA for my Lab"
- If Classic feels like a chore, entire paradigm fails
- Must be engaging enough for 30% of session time

**PR-003: 20+ Variants by Day 30**
- Requires 24,000 DNA over 30 days
- 5 runs/day × 160 DNA/run × 30 days = 24,000 DNA
- Classic Mode must generate predictable ~160 DNA per run (average player)
- Too low = progression stalls, too high = content consumed too fast

## Level 1: Direct Implementation

### 1.1 Mode Configuration

**Classic Mode Parameters:**

```typescript
interface ClassicModeConfig {
  // Session parameters
  targetDuration: 300,        // 5 minutes (300 seconds)

  // Energy cost
  energyCost: 1,              // DECISION NEEDED: 10 or 20?

  // Arena
  gridWidth: 20,              // Portrait mobile-optimized
  gridHeight: 35,             // 20×35 = 700 cells

  // Snake behavior
  baseSpeed: 6,               // Grid cells per second (constant)
  startLength: 3,             // Initial segments
  growthPerFood: 1,           // Standard Snake growth

  // Food spawning
  foodCount: 1,               // One food at a time
  foodRespawnDelay: 0,        // Immediate respawn

  // Difficulty
  obstacles: [],              // No obstacles (pure Snake)
  speedIncrease: 0,           // No speed scaling (fixed 6 cells/sec)

  // Rewards
  dnaMultiplier: 1.0,         // Base DNA rate (160 avg)
  materialDrops: [],          // No rare materials (just DNA)

  // Victory conditions
  victoryMode: 'time',        // 'time' or 'score'
  victoryTarget: 300,         // 5 minutes OR 200 score (TBD)

  // Aesthetic
  music: 'lofi_chill',        // Relaxing, not intense
  background: 'lab_blue',     // Calm laboratory theme
  particles: 'minimal'        // Low-intensity VFX
}
```

### 1.2 Energy Cost Decision (CRITICAL)

**Option A: 10 Energy per Run**

```
Full energy pool: 100 energy
Runs per full pool: 100 / 10 = 10 runs
Recharge rate: 1 energy per minute (20 min = 20 energy)
Runs per day: 10 full pool + 1,440 min = 144 energy/day = 14 runs/day max
Realistic daily: 5-7 runs (accounting for sleep, work)
```

**Advantages:**
- Higher session frequency (more return triggers)
- Energy depletes slower (less frustration)
- Enables longer play sessions (10 runs = 50 minutes)
- More forgiving for beginners

**Disadvantages:**
- Less scarcity = lower perceived value of energy
- Harder to justify energy purchases (10 runs is a lot)
- May not create strong enough return triggers
- Energy feels abundant, not strategic

**Option B: 20 Energy per Run**

```
Full energy pool: 100 energy
Runs per full pool: 100 / 20 = 5 runs
Recharge rate: 1 energy per minute (20 min = 20 energy = 1 run)
Runs per day: 5 full pool + ~7 recharge runs = 12 runs/day max
Realistic daily: 5-6 runs (aligned with target)
```

**Advantages:**
- Strong scarcity = high perceived value
- Creates clear return triggers (every 20 min = 1 run ready)
- Energy purchases feel valuable (5 runs = meaningful boost)
- Aligns perfectly with 5 runs/day target (CE-002)

**Disadvantages:**
- Faster energy depletion (frustration risk)
- Shorter play sessions (5 runs = 25 minutes)
- May feel restrictive for engaged players
- Less forgiving for experimentation

**RECOMMENDATION: Option B (20 Energy per Run)**

**Rationale:**
1. **Aligns with progression targets:** 5 runs/day × 160 DNA = 800 DNA/day = 24,000 DNA by Day 30 (PR-003) ✓
2. **Creates scarcity value:** Energy feels precious, purchases feel valuable (monetization)
3. **Return triggers:** 20 minutes = 1 run ready = clear return signal (CE-002)
4. **Daily free refill impact:** +100 energy = +5 runs (meaningful bonus, not trivial)
5. **Prevents overplay fatigue:** 5 runs = 25 minutes = sustainable daily commitment

**Mitigation for Restrictiveness:**
- Daily free refill: +5 runs (doubles daily capacity)
- Clan bonuses: +1 energy every 6 hours (+4 runs/day potential)
- Ad rewards (opt-in): +1 energy per ad (1-2/day)
- Result: 5 base + 5 refill + 4 clan + 2 ads = 16 runs/day potential (plenty)

### 1.3 Victory Condition Decision

**Option A: Time-Based Victory (5 Minutes)**

```typescript
interface TimeBasedVictory {
  condition: 'survive 5 minutes',
  reward: calculateDNA(score, combo, duration: 300),
  experience: 'Relaxing resource collection'
}
```

**Advantages:**
- Predictable session length (exactly 5 minutes if skilled)
- Can't be rushed (prevents degenerate speed strategies)
- Encourages consistent, methodical play
- Clear goal: "Survive 5 minutes"

**Disadvantages:**
- Skill ceiling: Expert players must wait full 5 minutes
- Less exciting ending (timer expires, no climax)
- May feel slow for skilled players

**Option B: Score-Based Victory (e.g., 200 Score)**

```typescript
interface ScoreBasedVictory {
  condition: 'reach 200 score',
  reward: calculateDNA(score, combo, duration),
  experience: 'Race to threshold'
}
```

**Advantages:**
- Skill expression: Experts finish faster
- Exciting ending (reaching threshold = victory moment)
- Variable session length (3-7 minutes)
- Encourages aggressive play

**Disadvantages:**
- Unpredictable session length (planning difficult)
- Beginners may never reach threshold (frustration)
- Speed incentive may conflict with "relaxing" identity

**Option C: Hybrid (Time OR Score)**

```typescript
interface HybridVictory {
  condition: 'survive 5 minutes OR reach 200 score',
  reward: calculateDNA(score, combo, duration),
  bonusForBoth: duration < 300 && score >= 200 ? 30 : 0
}
```

**Advantages:**
- Accessibility: Beginners get 5-minute safety net
- Skill expression: Experts can finish faster
- Double goal creates aspiration ("Can I get 200 before time?")
- Best of both worlds

**Disadvantages:**
- Slightly more complex to explain
- Requires UI to show both conditions

**RECOMMENDATION: Option C (Hybrid Victory)**

**Implementation:**
```typescript
class ClassicModeVictory {
  private timeLimit = 300; // 5 minutes
  private scoreThreshold = 200; // 20 food items (20 × 10 = 200)

  checkVictory(game: SnakeGame): VictoryResult | null {
    const duration = game.getElapsedTime();
    const score = game.getScore();

    // Victory condition 1: Time limit reached
    if (duration >= this.timeLimit) {
      return {
        type: 'time_limit',
        message: 'Time Complete!',
        bonus: 0
      };
    }

    // Victory condition 2: Score threshold reached
    if (score >= this.scoreThreshold) {
      const timeBonus = duration < this.timeLimit ? 30 : 0;
      return {
        type: 'score_threshold',
        message: 'Target Score Achieved!',
        bonus: timeBonus // Bonus for finishing early
      };
    }

    return null; // Continue playing
  }
}
```

**Rationale:**
1. **Accessibility:** All players can reach 5-minute timer (guaranteed win)
2. **Skill expression:** Experts race to 200 score faster (3-4 minutes possible)
3. **Aspiration:** "Can I beat 200 before timer?" creates challenge
4. **Relaxing + Engaging:** Safe if you play carefully, rewarding if you push
5. **Clear UI:** Show both timer AND score threshold with progress bars

### 1.4 Difficulty Tuning

**Classic Mode Difficulty Philosophy:**
- **Easier than Tower Mode:** No obstacles, no speed increases
- **Accessible to beginners:** 60%+ completion rate target
- **Room for mastery:** Experts can optimize combos and speed
- **Not punishing:** Deaths feel fair, not cheap

**Difficulty Parameters:**

```typescript
interface ClassicDifficulty {
  // Snake speed (constant)
  speed: 6,                   // Grid cells per second
  speedProgression: 'none',   // No increases

  // Arena hazards
  walls: 'edges_only',        // Just arena boundaries
  obstacles: [],              // None
  movingHazards: [],          // None

  // Food
  foodPositioning: 'fair',    // Never in corners or unreachable
  foodSpawnRate: 'constant',  // Always 1 at a time

  // Collision
  headHitbox: 1.0,            // Exact grid collision (fair)
  bodyHitbox: 1.0,            // Exact grid collision
  foodHitbox: 1.3,            // Lenient (30% overlap OK)

  // Forgiveness
  wallBounce: false,          // Death on wall hit
  selfBite: 'death',          // Death on self collision
  secondChances: 0            // No revives in Classic
}
```

**Comparison with Tower Mode (v0.5):**

```
Parameter              Classic Mode    Tower Mode
---------              ------------    ----------
Speed                  6 (fixed)       6→12 (progressive)
Obstacles              0               2-50 (scaling)
Food count             1               1-3 (scaling)
Session length         5 min           15-45 min
Difficulty             Easy            Progressive Hard
DNA rewards            Predictable     High-variance
Purpose                Daily grind     Challenge/Prestige
```

### 1.5 Arena and Visuals

## Level 2: System Effects

### 2.1 Integration with Energy System

**Energy Flow:**

```typescript
// Player initiates Classic Mode run
async function startClassicMode(userId: string): Promise<RunResult> {
  // Step 1: Check energy availability
  const energyAvailable = await EnergySystem.checkBalance(userId);
  if (energyAvailable < 20) {
    return {
      success: false,
      reason: 'insufficient_energy',
      energyNeeded: 20,
      energyCurrent: energyAvailable
    };
  }

  // Step 2: Deduct energy (BEFORE run starts, prevents farming)
  await EnergySystem.consume(userId, 20);

  // Step 3: Start Classic Mode game
  const game = new SnakeGame(CLASSIC_MODE_CONFIG);
  const result = await game.play();

  // Step 4: Award DNA based on performance
  const dna = calculateDNA(result);
  await ResourceGeneration.awardDNA(userId, dna, result.runId);

  return {
    success: true,
    dna: dna,
    score: result.score,
    duration: result.duration
  };
}
```

**Energy Refund Edge Case:**
```typescript
// If player quits within 10 seconds, refund energy
if (result.duration < 10 && result.reason === 'quit') {
  await EnergySystem.refund(userId, 20);
  return { success: false, reason: 'early_quit', refunded: true };
}
```

**Daily Energy Budget:**
```
Starting energy: 100
Energy per run: 20
Base runs per day: 5 runs

Daily free refill: +100 energy = +5 runs
Clan bonus (active): +20 energy/6hr × 4 = +80 energy = +4 runs
Ad rewards (opt-in): +20 energy/ad × 2 = +40 energy = +2 runs

Total potential: 5 + 5 + 4 + 2 = 16 runs/day max
Realistic average: 5-7 runs/day for engaged players
```

### 2.2 Integration with Resource Generation

**DNA Reward Calculation:**

Classic Mode uses the standard DNA formula from Resource Generation System:

```typescript
function calculateDNA(run: ClassicModeResult): number {
  const baseDNA = Math.floor(run.score / 50) * 2;
  const comboBonus = Math.floor(run.maxCombo / 5) * 5;
  const timeBonus = run.duration < 180 ? 20 : 0; // <3 min bonus

  return baseDNA + comboBonus + timeBonus;
}
```

**Classic Mode Target DNA:**
```
Beginner:  Score ~2,000, Combo ~5, Time >3min  →  95 DNA
Average:   Score ~3,500, Combo ~10, Time ~2:45 →  160 DNA ✓
Expert:    Score ~6,000, Combo ~25, Time ~3:30 →  275 DNA
```

**5-Run Daily Totals:**
```
Beginner: 95 × 5 = 475 DNA/day
Average:  160 × 5 = 800 DNA/day (target for PR-003)
Expert:   275 × 5 = 1,375 DNA/day
```

**Day 30 Progression Validation:**
```
Average player: 800 DNA/day × 30 days = 24,000 DNA
24,000 DNA / 1,200 DNA per variant (avg cost) = 20 variants ✓ (meets PR-003)
```

### 2.3 Integration with Leaderboards

**Classic Mode Leaderboards:**

```typescript
interface ClassicLeaderboards {
  daily: {
    type: 'daily_dna_earned',
    resetFrequency: '24 hours',
    ranking: 'Total DNA earned today from Classic Mode',
    reward: 'Top 10: +100 DNA bonus'
  },

  weekly: {
    type: 'weekly_runs_completed',
    resetFrequency: '7 days',
    ranking: 'Total Classic runs completed this week',
    reward: 'Top 50: +500 DNA bonus'
  },

  allTime: {
    type: 'best_single_run',
    resetFrequency: 'never',
    ranking: 'Highest DNA earned in single Classic run',
    reward: 'Prestige badge'
  },

  friends: {
    type: 'friend_comparison',
    resetFrequency: 'real-time',
    ranking: 'Your DNA vs. friends\' DNA today',
    reward: 'Bragging rights'
  }
}
```

**Leaderboard Integration:**
```typescript
// After each Classic Mode run, update leaderboards
async function updateLeaderboards(
  userId: string,
  result: ClassicModeResult,
  dna: number
): Promise<void> {
  await Promise.all([
    LeaderboardService.addToDailyDNA(userId, dna),
    LeaderboardService.incrementWeeklyRuns(userId),
    LeaderboardService.updateBestRun(userId, dna, result.score),
    LeaderboardService.updateFriendsComparison(userId, dna)
  ]);
}
```

**Social Comparison:**
```
Friend Activity Feed:
"Alex earned 280 DNA in Classic Mode!" (Your best: 160)
→ Creates aspiration: "Can I beat that?"
→ Drives engagement: Play another run to improve
```

### 2.4 Integration with Clan System

**Clan Bonus for Classic Mode:**

```typescript
function calculateClanBonus(
  baseDNA: number,
  clanActiveMembersToday: number
): number {
  // +5% DNA per active clan member, max 25%
  const bonusPercent = Math.min(clanActiveMembersToday * 0.05, 0.25);
  const bonus = Math.floor(baseDNA * bonusPercent);

  return bonus;
}

// Example:
// Base DNA: 160
// Clan (5 active): 160 × 1.25 = 200 DNA (+40 bonus)
// Clan (10+ active): 160 × 1.25 = 200 DNA (capped at 25%)
```

**Impact:**
```
Solo player: 160 DNA/run × 5 runs = 800 DNA/day
Clan player: 200 DNA/run × 5 runs = 1,000 DNA/day (+25%)

Monthly: 1,000 × 30 = 30,000 DNA (vs 24,000 solo)
Benefit: +6,000 DNA = ~5 extra variants per month
```

**Strategic Implication:**
- Clan membership provides meaningful benefit (5 variants/month)
- But NOT mandatory (solo players still hit PR-003 target)
- Creates social pressure: "Log in so clan gets bonus"
- Balances SO-001 (40% clan participation) with solo viability

### 2.5 Classic Mode as "Gateway Drug"

**Onboarding Flow:**
```
Tutorial (60 seconds) → First Classic Mode Run → Snake Lab Discovery
```

**First Session Experience:**
```
1. Complete tutorial (guided Snake run)
2. Earn first 50 DNA
3. "You've discovered the Snake Lab!" (paradigm shift)
4. Use DNA to unlock first variant
5. "Play Classic Mode to earn more DNA" (hook set)
```

**Classic Mode Teaches:**
- Snake gameplay basics (controls, growth, death)
- DNA generation (score → resources)
- Energy system (limited runs create value)
- Lab connection (Snake is means to Lab ends)

**If Classic Mode Fails to Hook:**
- D1 retention <40% → Classic isn't engaging enough
- Players don't return after first session
- Energy depletion feels punishing, not strategic
- Entire paradigm shift fails

**Therefore Classic Mode is CRITICAL for onboarding:**
- Must feel premium (60fps, polished feel)
- Must feel fair (deterministic collision)
- Must feel rewarding (DNA generation visible)
- Must feel respectful of time (5-minute sessions)

---

## Level 3: Game Balance

### 3.1 Session Length Distribution

**Target:** 5 minutes average

**Skill-Based Distribution:**
```
Beginner players (25th percentile):
- Deaths: 3-4 per run
- Session length: 2-3 minutes (die early)
- DNA: 95 per run

Average players (50th percentile):
- Deaths: 1-2 per run
- Session length: 4-5 minutes
- DNA: 160 per run

Expert players (75th percentile):
- Deaths: 0-1 per run (reach time/score victory)
- Session length: 5-7 minutes
- DNA: 275 per run
```

**Victory Condition Impact:**

With hybrid victory (5 min OR 200 score):
```
Beginners:  Survive ~2-3 min, die, restart → 3 attempts = 8 min total
Average:    Reach 200 score in 4-5 min → 5 min session ✓
Experts:    Reach 200 score in 3-4 min → 4 min session
```

**Session Length Tuning:**
- If P50 < 4 min: Increase score threshold (200 → 250) or increase time limit (5 → 6 min)
- If P50 > 6 min: Decrease score threshold (200 → 180) or decrease time limit (5 → 4 min)
- **Goal:** Median session length = 5 minutes ±30 seconds

### 3.2 Difficulty Curve (Lack Thereof)

**Classic Mode Philosophy:** NO difficulty curve

**Rationale:**
1. **Predictability:** Players know what to expect every run
2. **Relaxing:** No escalating pressure
3. **Consistency:** DNA rewards predictable (not RNG-based)
4. **Accessibility:** Beginners aren't punished by increasing difficulty

**Comparison:**
```
Classic Mode: Difficulty = 5/10 (constant)
Tower Mode:   Difficulty = 3/10 (floor 1) → 9/10 (floor 50)
```

**No Speed Increases:**
```typescript
// Classic Mode speed
baseSpeed: 6,           // Grid cells per second
speedIncrease: 0,       // No progression
maxSpeed: 6             // Cap at starting speed
```

**No Obstacle Progression:**
```typescript
obstacles: [],          // Empty array
obstacleSpawnRate: 0    // Never spawn
```

**Result:**
- Run 1 difficulty = Run 100 difficulty = Run 1000 difficulty
- Players improve through skill, not game getting easier
- Mastery comes from personal improvement, not content familiarity

### 3.3 DNA Earn Rate Balance

**Target:** 160 DNA per run (average player)

**Sensitivity Analysis:**

```
±10% DNA change impact:

Current:  160 DNA/run × 150 runs (30 days) = 24,000 DNA → 20 variants ✓

-10%:     144 DNA/run × 150 runs = 21,600 DNA → 18 variants
Impact: Miss PR-003 target by 2 variants (90% of goal)

+10%:     176 DNA/run × 150 runs = 26,400 DNA → 22 variants
Impact: Exceed PR-003 target by 2 variants (110% of goal)

±20% DNA change impact:

-20%:     128 DNA/run × 150 runs = 19,200 DNA → 16 variants
Impact: Miss target by 4 variants (80% of goal) - UNACCEPTABLE

+20%:     192 DNA/run × 150 runs = 28,800 DNA → 24 variants
Impact: Exceed target by 4 variants (120% of goal) - Too fast
```

**Safe Tuning Range:**
- Lower bound: 145 DNA/run (18 variants by Day 30)
- Target: 160 DNA/run (20 variants) ✓
- Upper bound: 175 DNA/run (22 variants)
- **Tolerance:** ±9% margin before missing or exceeding targets significantly

**A/B Testing Variants (Soft Launch):**
```
Group A: 150 DNA/run (6% below target)
Group B: 160 DNA/run (target baseline)
Group C: 170 DNA/run (6% above target)

Measure:
- D7 retention (does more DNA improve retention?)
- D30 variants (which group hits 20 variants?)
- Grind perception (survey: "Does earning DNA feel like a grind?")

Choose: Group with highest D7 retention within ±10% DNA range
```

### 3.4 Completion Rate Targets

**Target:** 60-70% of Classic runs reach victory condition

**Definition of "Completion":**
- Reach 5-minute time limit OR
- Reach 200 score threshold

**Skill-Based Completion Rates:**
```
Beginners:  40-50% completion (acceptable, learning curve)
Average:    60-70% completion ✓ (target)
Experts:    85-95% completion (mastery)
```

**If Completion Rate Too Low (<50%):**
- Victory threshold too high (200 → 150 score)
- Time limit too short (5 → 6 minutes)
- Speed too fast (6 → 5.5 cells/sec)
- Difficulty too punishing (add forgiveness)

**If Completion Rate Too High (>80%):**
- Victory threshold too low (200 → 250 score)
- Time limit too long (5 → 4 minutes)
- Speed too slow (6 → 6.5 cells/sec)
- Not enough challenge (may feel boring)

**Completion Rate Monitoring:**
```typescript
// Track per-user completion rates
interface CompletionMetrics {

### 3.5 Balancing "Relaxing" vs. "Boring"

**Challenge:** Classic must be engaging but not stressful

**"Relaxing" Indicators (Good):**
- Players describe as "chill," "comfortable," "nice break"
- Session frequency: 3-5 runs/day (returns voluntarily)
- Music and SFX mentioned positively
- Used as "palette cleanser" between Lab activities

**"Boring" Indicators (Bad):**
- Players describe as "repetitive," "tedious," "grind"
- Session frequency: 1-2 runs/day (only for DNA, not enjoyment)
- Quit rate >20% mid-run
- Suggestions for "skip run, just give DNA" feature

**Balance Mechanisms:**

1. **Combo System (Engagement):**
```
Combos create micro-goals within runs
"Can I get 15-combo this time?" = engagement
Rewards skill without requiring stress
```

2. **Victory Condition Variety (Challenge):**
```
Hybrid (time OR score) creates choice:
- Play safe → reach 5 minutes
- Push for score → finish in 3-4 minutes
Choice = agency = engagement
```

3. **Progression Perception (Meaning):**
```
Not "playing Snake again"
But "collecting 160 DNA for my next breed"
Purpose transforms grind into mining
```

4. **Aesthetic Variety (Freshness):**
```
5 arena backgrounds (v0.1)
20+ arena backgrounds (v1.0)
Dynasty-specific snake skins
Periodic visual updates prevent staleness
```

## Level 4: Economy

### 4.1 Classic Mode as Primary DNA Source

**Economic Position:**
```
Primary DNA source: 100% of base DNA
Secondary sources: Daily bonuses, clan bonuses, achievements
Premium DNA: None (indirect via energy refills)

Classic Mode contribution: 95%+ of earned DNA
Other modes (Tower v0.5): <5% of earned DNA initially
```

**Daily DNA Generation:**
```
Runs per day: 5 (base energy)
DNA per run: 160 (average)
Daily DNA: 800

With bonuses:
- Daily streak: +50 DNA (6.25% bonus)
- Clan bonus: +200 DNA (25% if 5+ active)
- Total: 1,050 DNA/day potential
```

**Monthly DNA Budget:**
```
Base: 800 DNA/day × 30 days = 24,000 DNA
Bonuses: 250 DNA/day × 30 days = 7,500 DNA
Total: 31,500 DNA/month (with engagement)
```

### 4.2 DNA Sink Pacing

**How Classic Mode DNA is Spent:**

```
Breeding costs:
- Gen 1→Gen 2: 200-350 DNA per breed
- Average: 450 DNA per breed
- Breeds needed for 20 variants: ~15 breeds = 6,750 DNA

Evolution costs (v0.5):
- Gen 5→Gen 6: 500 DNA
- Gen 6→Gen 7: 1,000 DNA
- Average: ~750 DNA per evolution

Shop purchases:
- Common items: 100-300 DNA
- Rare items: 500-1,000 DNA
- Occasional purchases: ~500 DNA/week
```

**Monthly Spending:**
```
Breeding: 15 breeds × 450 DNA = 6,750 DNA
Shop: 4 weeks × 500 DNA = 2,000 DNA
Total spent: 8,750 DNA

Monthly surplus: 24,000 earned - 8,750 spent = 15,250 DNA banked
Savings rate: 63% (healthy accumulation)
```

### 4.3 Energy-to-DNA Efficiency

**Classic Mode Efficiency:**
```
20 energy → 1 Classic run
1 Classic run (avg) → 160 DNA
20 energy → 160 DNA

Efficiency: 8 DNA per energy
```

**Premium Energy Economics:**
```
Energy bundle: $2.99
Energy received: +100 energy
Runs enabled: +5 Classic runs
DNA generated: 5 × 160 = 800 DNA

Cost per DNA: $2.99 / 800 = $0.00374 per DNA
Cost per variant (1,200 DNA): $4.49

Monthly spending (2 bundles/week):
8 bundles × $2.99 = $23.92/month
Benefit: +6,400 DNA = +5 variants
```

**F2P vs. Premium (Classic Mode):**
```
F2P (5 runs/day):
- Daily DNA: 800
- Monthly DNA: 24,000
- Variants by Day 30: 20

Premium (+2 energy bundles/week):
- Daily DNA: 800 + 228 = 1,028 (average with bonuses)
- Monthly DNA: 30,800
- Variants by Day 30: 25 (+5 vs F2P)
- Cost: $23.92/month

Key: Premium gets 28% more DNA through time, not power (BM-001) ✓
```

### 4.4 Classic Mode in Multi-Mode Economy (v0.5+)

**When Tower Mode Launches (v0.5):**

```
Classic Mode:
- Energy cost: 20 per run
- DNA: 160 average (predictable)
- Materials: None
- Purpose: Reliable daily grind

Tower Mode:
- Energy cost: 40 per run
- DNA: 200-400 (high variance)
- Materials: Prismatic Scales, Quantum DNA (rare)
- Purpose: High-risk challenge
```

**Player Energy Allocation:**
```
100 energy daily budget:
- Option A: 5 Classic runs = 800 DNA
- Option B: 2 Tower runs = 600 DNA (avg) + materials
- Option C: 3 Classic + 1 Tower = 480 + 300 = 780 DNA + materials

Most players: Option A (Classic) for consistency
Risk-takers: Option C (mixed) for variety
Hardcore: Option B (Tower) for materials
```

**Classic Mode Remains Primary:**
- 70-80% of runs will still be Classic (even with Tower available)
- Tower is prestigious alternative, not replacement
- Classic's predictability ensures stable economy

### 4.5 Long-Term DNA Accumulation

**Accumulation Pattern:**
```
Day 1-7:   +5,600 DNA (spend most for rapid unlocks)
Day 8-14:  +5,600 DNA (slower spending, start saving)
Day 15-21: +5,600 DNA (accumulation phase)
Day 22-30: +5,600 DNA (large bank forming)

Day 30 state:
- Earned: 24,000 DNA (from Classic)
- Spent: 8,750 DNA (breeding, shop)
- Banked: 15,250 DNA (for future goals)
```

**Banking Creates:**
1. **Security:** Not living paycheck-to-paycheck
2. **Strategic depth:** Save for expensive evolutions
3. **Impulse purchases:** Can afford occasional splurge
4. **Prestige prep:** Accumulate for prestige system (50,000 DNA reset)

Display: "You're in top 30% of contributors"
Impact: Shows value to clan, encourages participation
```

### 5.3 Friend Comparison

**Friend Activity Feed:**
```
"Alex earned 280 DNA in Classic Mode!" (Beat your best: 160)
→ Notification: "Can you beat Alex's run?"
→ Call to action: "Play Classic Mode"

"Jamie unlocked 25th variant!" (You have 18)
→ FOMO: "I need to catch up"
→ Implication: "Need more DNA = more Classic runs"

"Your clan is 200 DNA behind 2nd place!"
→ Social pressure: "One more Classic run helps"
```

**Direct Challenges:**
```
Feature: "Challenge friend to Classic run"

Alex challenges you:
"Can you beat my 240 DNA run?"

Accept challenge → Play Classic run → Compare results
Winner: Bragging rights + small DNA bonus (+50)

Impact: Converts solo activity into social competition
```

### 5.4 Fashion Contests and Classic Mode

**Showcase Integration:**
```
Gallery: "Show off your favorite snake"

To showcase snake, must:
1. Own the variant
2. Play 10+ Classic runs with it (prove mastery)
3. Earn average 180+ DNA with it (skill gate)

Result: Classic Mode becomes vehicle for fashion competition
"I love this NEBULA snake" → Play Classic with it → Showcase
```

### 5.5 Social Motivation Drivers

**Classic Mode Social Hooks:**

1. **Daily comparison:** "Your friends earned 3,200 DNA today (you: 800)"
2. **Clan pressure:** "Clan needs 500 more DNA for bonus"
3. **Challenge notifications:** "Alex beat your best run"
4. **Milestone celebrations:** "You're in top 100 DNA earners this week!"
5. **Showcase requirements:** "Play 5 more Classic runs to unlock showcase"

**Result:**
- Solo activity (Classic Mode) feels socially meaningful
- Not playing = letting clan down / falling behind friends
- Drives daily engagement beyond intrinsic fun

---

## Level 6: Technical

### 6.1 Client-Server Architecture

**Classic Mode Flow:**

```typescript
// Client-side
class ClassicModeClient {
  async startRun(): Promise<void> {
    // 1. Request energy deduction (server validates)
    const energyCheck = await api.post('/classic/start', {
      userId: this.userId
    });

    if (!energyCheck.success) {
      this.showEnergyDepleted();
      return;
    }

    // 2. Start local game (60fps gameplay)
    this.runId = energyCheck.runId;
    this.game = new SnakeGame(CLASSIC_CONFIG);
    this.replayRecorder = new ReplayRecorder();

    // 3. Play game (all client-side for 60fps)
    await this.game.play();

    // 4. Submit results + replay to server
    await this.submitResults();
  }

  async submitResults(): Promise<void> {
    const results = {
      runId: this.runId,
      score: this.game.getScore(),
      foodEaten: this.game.getFoodEaten(),
      maxCombo: this.game.getMaxCombo(),
      duration: this.game.getDuration(),
      replayData: this.replayRecorder.getData()
    };

    const response = await api.post('/classic/complete', results);

    this.showResults({
      dna: response.dnaAwarded,
      breakdown: response.breakdown
    });
  }
}

// Server-side validation
async function validateClassicRun(submission: RunSubmission): Promise<number> {
  // 1. Replay validation (anti-cheat)
  const replay = await validateReplay(submission.replayData);

  if (!replay.valid) {
    await logCheatAttempt(submission.userId);
    return 0;
  }

  // 2. Server calculates DNA (never trust client)
  const dna = calculateDNA({
    score: replay.score,
    maxCombo: replay.maxCombo,
    duration: replay.duration
  });

  // 3. Award DNA
  await awardDNA(submission.userId, dna, submission.runId);

  return dna;
}
```

### 6.2 Offline Capability (TE-002)

**Classic Mode Offline:**

```typescript
class OfflineClassicMode {
  async startRun(): Promise<void> {
    // Check if online
    if (!navigator.onLine) {
      // Offline mode: Play locally, queue results
      this.offlineMode = true;
      await this.playOffline();
    } else {
      // Online mode: Normal flow
      await this.playOnline();
    }
  }

  async playOffline(): Promise<void> {
    // 1. Check local energy cache
    const localEnergy = await localDB.getEnergy();
    if (localEnergy < 20) {
      this.showEnergyDepleted();
      return;
    }

    // 2. Deduct energy locally
    await localDB.consumeEnergy(20);

    // 3. Play game (full Snake gameplay works offline)
    await this.game.play();

    // 4. Queue results for sync when online
    await offlineQueue.add({
      type: 'classic_run',
      results: this.game.getResults(),
      replay: this.replayRecorder.getData(),
      timestamp: Date.now()
    });

    // 5. Show provisional results
    this.showResults({
      dna: this.calculateLocalDNA(),
      provisional: true,
      message: 'Results will sync when online'
    });
  }

  async syncOfflineRuns(): Promise<void> {
    // When connection restored
    const queuedRuns = await offlineQueue.getAll();

    for (const run of queuedRuns) {
      await api.post('/classic/complete-offline', run);
    }

    await offlineQueue.clear();
    await this.refreshBalance(); // Update DNA from server
  }
}
```

**Offline Constraints:**
- Classic gameplay: ✓ Works offline (all client-side)
- Energy tracking: ✓ Local cache (syncs when online)
- DNA awards: ✓ Queued, awarded when online
- Leaderboards: ✗ Requires connection
- Clan bonuses: ✗ Requires connection

### 6.3 Performance Requirements (GP-001)

**60fps Target (16.67ms frame budget):**

```
Classic Mode Performance Budget (per frame):

Input processing:     0.5ms
Snake update:         1.0ms
Collision detection:  0.5ms
Food management:      0.2ms
Camera update:        0.2ms
Rendering:           12.0ms
Audio triggers:       0.1ms
UI updates:           0.5ms
Overhead:             1.67ms (buffer)
------------------------------
Total:               16.67ms ✓
```

**Performance Optimization:**
```typescript
class OptimizedClassicMode {
  // Object pooling (avoid GC pauses)
  private particlePool: ParticlePool;
  private segmentPool: SegmentPool;

  // Spatial hashing (O(1) collision detection)
  private spatialGrid: SpatialHashGrid;

  // Dirty rectangles (only redraw changed regions)
  private dirtyRectTracker: DirtyRectTracker;

  update(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update only what changed
    this.snake.update(deltaTime);
    this.spatialGrid.updateCell(this.snake.head);

    // Mark dirty regions
    this.dirtyRectTracker.markDirty(
      this.snake.previousHeadPosition,
      this.snake.currentHeadPosition
    );
  }

  render(): void {
    // Render only dirty regions
    const dirtyRects = this.dirtyRectTracker.getDirtyRects();

    for (const rect of dirtyRects) {
      this.renderRegion(rect);
    }

    this.dirtyRectTracker.clear();
  }
}
```

**Target Devices:**
```
Minimum: iPhone 12, Samsung Galaxy S21 (2020-2021)
- 60fps sustained ✓
- <300MB memory ✓
- <5% battery drain per 5-minute session ✓
```

### 6.4 Replay Recording (Anti-Cheat)

**Replay Data Structure:**

```typescript
interface ReplayFrame {
  frameNumber: number;
  timestamp: number;
  input: {
    direction: Direction;
    timestamp: number;
  } | null;
  state: {
    headPosition: { x: number; y: number };
    segmentCount: number;
    score: number;
    foodPosition: { x: number; y: number };
  };
}

interface ReplayData {
  runId: string;
  version: string;
  config: ClassicModeConfig;
  frames: ReplayFrame[];
  finalResult: {
    score: number;
    foodEaten: number;
    maxCombo: number;
    duration: number;
  };
}
```

**Replay Compression:**
```typescript
// Delta compression (only store changes)
class CompressedReplay {
  compress(frames: ReplayFrame[]): CompressedReplayData {
    const keyframes = [];
    const deltaframes = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < frames.length; i++) {
      if (i % 60 === 0) {
        // Keyframe every 1 second (60fps)
        keyframes.push(frames[i]);
      } else {
        // Delta from previous frame
        deltaframes.push(this.computeDelta(frames[i - 1], frames[i]));
      }
    }

    return { keyframes, deltaframes };
  }
}

// Result: 300 frames (5 min) = ~50KB compressed (down from 500KB raw)
```

### 6.5 Real-Time DNA Updates

**Live Balance Sync:**

```typescript
class DNABalanceSync {
  private subscription: RealtimeChannel;

  initialize(userId: string): void {
    // Subscribe to user's DNA balance updates
    this.subscription = supabase
      .channel(`user:${userId}:dna`)
      .on('postgres_changes', {
        event: 'UPDATE',
        schema: 'public',
        table: 'user_dna',
        filter: `user_id=eq.${userId}`
      }, (payload) => {
        // Update UI instantly when DNA changes
        this.updateDNADisplay(payload.new.balance);

        // Animate DNA counter change
        this.animateDNAIncrease(
          payload.old.balance,
          payload.new.balance
        );
      })
      .subscribe();
  }
}
```

**Multi-Device Sync:**
```
Scenario: Player on iPhone completes Classic run, also has iPad open

iPhone: Completes run → awards 160 DNA → updates database
Server: Broadcasts DNA update via Supabase Realtime
iPad: Receives update → animates DNA counter → shows +160

Result: Instant sync across all devices
```

## Level 8: Meta-game and Retention

### 8.1 Classic Mode in Daily Routine

**Habitual Play Pattern:**

```
Morning (7-9 AM):
- Wake up → Check phone → Open SupaSnake
- Energy recharged overnight (100 full)
- Play 2 Classic runs (10 min)
- Earn ~320 DNA
- Spend DNA on breeding in Lab

Lunch (12-1 PM):
- Break time → Check phone
- Energy recharged (40 energy = 2 runs)
- Play 2 Classic runs (10 min)
- Earn ~320 DNA
- Check leaderboards, compare with friends

Evening (7-10 PM):
- After dinner → Relaxation time
- Energy recharged (40 energy = 2 runs)
- Play 2 Classic runs (10 min)
- Earn ~320 DNA
- Browse Lab, plan next day's breeding

Daily total: 6 runs, ~960 DNA, 30 minutes play
```

**Habit Formation:**
```
Week 1: "I should play to earn DNA" (extrinsic motivation)
Week 2: "I enjoy these chill Snake runs" (intrinsic emerges)
Week 3: "It's part of my routine" (habit formation)
Week 4: "Feels weird NOT to play" (habit solidified)
```

### 8.2 Classic Mode as Gateway to Other Content

**Progression Funnel:**

```
Day 1: Classic Mode only
Day 7: Classic Mode + Breeding
Day 14: Classic Mode + Evolution (v0.5)
Day 21: Classic Mode + Tower Mode (v0.5)
Day 30: Classic Mode + Clan Wars (v1.0)

Classic Mode remains constant anchor
New content layers on top
```

**DNA Requirement Drives Engagement:**

```
Player wants to breed → Needs 500 DNA → Plays 3 Classic runs
Player wants to evolve → Needs 1,000 DNA → Plays 6 Classic runs
Player wants rare dynasty → Needs 3,000 DNA → Plays 18 Classic runs

Classic Mode converts desire (Lab goals) into action (Snake gameplay)
```

### 8.3 Retention Mechanics

**Daily Incentives:**

```
Login streak bonuses:
Day 1: +50 DNA
Day 2: +50 DNA
Day 3: +75 DNA
Day 4: +75 DNA
Day 5: +100 DNA
Day 6: +100 DNA
Day 7: +200 DNA (big reward)

Total week: +650 DNA = 4 Classic runs worth

Result: Daily return for bonus, play Classic while there
```

**Weekly Challenges:**

```
Challenge: "Complete 30 Classic runs this week"
Reward: +500 DNA + exclusive snake skin
Target: 30 runs / 7 days = 4.3 runs/day (slightly above base 5)

Psychology: "I'm at 28/30, just 2 more runs!" (completion drive)
```

**Classic Mode-Specific Achievements:**

```
"First 100 Runs" → +500 DNA
"1000 DNA in Single Run" → Prestige badge
"30-Day Streak" → Exclusive dynasty unlock
"Reach 200 Score in Under 3 Minutes" → Speed demon title

Impact: Long-term goals keep Classic engaging beyond DNA farming
```

### 8.4 Avoiding "Grind" Perception

**Classic Mode Anti-Grind Design:**

1. **Short Sessions (5 min):**
   - Never feels like marathon grind
   - Can complete run in short break
   - Respects player's time

2. **Energy Gating (20 per run):**
   - Can't grind endlessly (max 5 runs before recharge)
   - Scarcity creates value
   - "I WANT to play more" not "I HAVE to play more"

3. **Variety Within Consistency:**
   - Same mode, but every run different (snake growth, combos)
   - Multiple arena backgrounds (visual variety)
   - Dynasty-specific snake skins (aesthetic variety)
   - Leaderboard competition (social variety)

4. **70/30 Time Split:**
   - 30% Snake (Classic Mode) feels like break FROM Lab
   - Not "grinding DNA" but "taking break to mine DNA"
   - Psychological framing: Classic is palette cleanser

5. **Tangible Progress:**
   - Every run = visible DNA gain
   - DNA → immediate use in Lab
   - Not "grinding for hours," but "earning 160 DNA in 5 minutes"

**Grind Perception Survey (Target Results):**
```
"Does Classic Mode feel like a grind?"

No, I enjoy it: 60%+ ✓
Sometimes, but rewards worth it: 30%
Yes, it's tedious: <10% (acceptable minority)

If "tedious" >15% → increase DNA/run or reduce energy cost
```

### 8.5 Long-Term Classic Mode Engagement

**Month 3+ Strategies:**

```
Content Updates:
- New arena backgrounds every month
- Seasonal events (holiday themes)
- Limited-time DNA multipliers (2x DNA weekends)

Mastery Progression:
- Classic Mode mastery levels (0-200)
- Unlock perks: "Start with 5 segments," "+10% combo DNA"
- Prestige: Reset mastery for permanent bonuses

Social Features:
- Clan vs. Clan Classic Mode tournaments
- Friend leaderboard reset monthly
- Showcases require Classic Mode play

Meta-Game Integration:
- Certain breeds require "100 Classic runs with this dynasty"
- Evolution needs "500 DNA from Classic Mode specifically"
- Gallery showcase: "Play 50 Classic runs with this snake"

Result: Classic Mode remains relevant for years, not just Day 1-30
```

### 8.6 Classic Mode as Identity

**Player Archetypes and Classic Mode:**

**The Completionist (35%):**
- Plays Classic for consistent DNA to complete collection
- Every Classic run = progress toward next variant
- Values predictability

**The Competitor (40%):**
- Plays Classic to top leaderboards
- Chases best DNA/run record
- Values skill expression

**The Expressionist (25%):**
- Plays Classic to showcase favorite snake
- Requires mastery to unlock showcase
- Values aesthetic + gameplay

**Result:**
- All archetypes find value in Classic Mode
- Not just for grinders
- Core activity for entire player base
