## Summary

SupaSnake converts players by revealing depth gradually. The journey from "just another snake game" to "my snake dynasty empire" happens through careful emotional orchestration. Energy creates session value, Snake Lab provides long-term goals, and dynasties enable self-expression. The monetization feels fair because players pay for time and convenience, not power.

**Core Insight**: Players don't pay for snakes. They pay to nurture their growing genetic empire when life's responsibilities would otherwise interrupt their carefully planned breeding schedule.

**Golden Rule**: Respect the player's intelligence and wallet equally.
