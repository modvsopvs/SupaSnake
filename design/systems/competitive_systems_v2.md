## 1. Ranked Ladder System

### 1.1 Tier Structure (Six-Tier Pyramid)

**Design Philosophy:** Wide base (accessible), narrow top (aspirational), clear progression milestones.

| Tier | Division Range | Trophy Range | % of Players | Season Rewards | Visual Identity |
|------|----------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Bronze** | I-III | 0-499 | 40% | 1,000 DNA + Rare Pod | Bronze border, simple badge |
| **Silver** | I-III | 500-999 | 30% | 3,000 DNA + Epic Pod | Silver border, polished badge |
| **Gold** | I-III | 1,000-1,999 | 18% | 7,000 DNA + Legendary Pod | Gold border, ornate badge |
| **Platinum** | I-III | 2,000-2,999 | 8% | 15,000 DNA + Legendary Pod + Title | Platinum border, animated |
| **Diamond** | I-III | 3,000-3,999 | 3% | 30,000 DNA + Mythic Pod + Cosmetic | Diamond border, particle effects |
| **Infinite** | No divisions | 4,000+ | 1% | 50,000 DNA + Exclusive Variants + Title | Rainbow border, full animation |

**Tier Characteristics:**

**Bronze (Tutorial Tier):**
- **Purpose:** Onboarding, learning mechanics, confidence building
- **Bot Integration:** 60% of matches against AI in Bronze III (gradually reduces to 20% in Bronze I)
- **Promotion:** +100 trophies = Bronze III → Bronze II → Bronze I → Silver III
- **Demotion:** Cannot drop below Bronze III (safety net for new players)
- **Typical Run:** 30-45 seconds, 20 DNA average, 5-combo max
- **Time to Escape:** 15-20 runs (2-3 hours for casual, 1 hour for skilled)

**Silver (Improving Tier):**
- **Purpose:** Skill development, first competitive challenges
- **Bot Integration:** 30% AI opponents in Silver III, 10% in Silver I
- **Promotion:** +100 trophies per division
- **Demotion:** Can drop to Bronze I (but not Bronze II/III)
- **Typical Run:** 45-60 seconds, 40 DNA average, 10-combo max
- **Time to Escape:** 30-40 runs (4-6 hours for improving players)

**Gold (Competitive Tier):**
- **Purpose:** Serious competition begins, meta knowledge required
- **Bot Integration:** None (100% human opponents)
- **Promotion:** +100 trophies per division
- **Demotion:** Can drop to Silver I
- **Typical Run:** 60-75 seconds, 60 DNA average, 15-combo max
- **Time to Escape:** 50-70 runs (8-12 hours of focused play)

**Platinum (Expert Tier):**
- **Purpose:** High-level mastery, exclusive cosmetics, prestige recognition
- **MMR Tightening:** Matches only against Platinum/Diamond (no Gold matchups)
- **Promotion:** +100 trophies per division
- **Demotion:** Can drop to Gold I (but floor at Gold III prevents full tier drop)
- **Typical Run:** 75-90 seconds, 80 DNA average, 20-combo max
- **Time to Escape:** 80-100 runs (15-20 hours of expert play)

**Diamond (Elite Tier):**
- **Purpose:** Pre-Infinite proving ground, top 3% status
- **MMR Tightening:** Matches only against Diamond/Infinite (extremely competitive)
- **Promotion:** +100 trophies per division
- **Demotion:** Can drop to Platinum I (significant rank loss = tilt recovery needed)
- **Typical Run:** 90-120 seconds, 100 DNA average, 25-combo max
- **Time to Escape:** 120-150 runs (25-35 hours of elite play)

**Infinite (Aspirational Tier):**
- **Purpose:** Top 1% global recognition, no demotion risk, seasonal leaderboard
- **Entry Requirement:** 4,000+ trophies (approximately top 500 global at launch, top 10,000 by Year 3)
- **No Demotion:** Cannot lose Infinite status once achieved (season reset only)
- **Leaderboard:** Ranked by current season trophies (4,000-10,000+ range)
- **Typical Run:** 120+ seconds, 150 DNA average, 30+ combo max
- **Prestige:** Exclusive avatar border, "Infinite" title, seasonal cosmetics

### 1.2 Trophy Mechanics

**Trophy Formula:**
```
Trophies = (DNA Collected × 0.5) + (Survival Seconds × 2) + (Max Combo × 10)

Examples:
Casual Run (30 DNA, 45s, 5-combo):
= (30 × 0.5) + (45 × 2) + (5 × 10)
= 15 + 90 + 50
= 155 trophies

Average Run (60 DNA, 75s, 15-combo):
= (60 × 0.5) + (75 × 2) + (15 × 10)
= 30 + 150 + 150
= 330 trophies

Expert Run (120 DNA, 120s, 30-combo):
= (120 × 0.5) + (120 × 2) + (30 × 10)
= 60 + 240 + 300
= 600 trophies
```

**Trophy Gain/Loss:**
- **Win (Above median for tier):** +Full trophies
- **Loss (Below median for tier):** -30% of theoretical trophies (softens punishment)
- **Early Death (<20s or <10 DNA):** -50 trophies (discourages rage-quits, minimal streak)
- **Perfect Run Bonus:** +10% trophies if survival >90s AND 0 close calls (near-death avoidance)

**Trophy Inflation Control:**
- **Season Soft Reset:** New rank = (Old rank - 3 divisions)
  - Infinite → Diamond I (3,900 → 3,000 trophies)
  - Diamond III → Platinum II (3,300 → 2,500 trophies)
  - Platinum I → Gold II (2,100 → 1,500 trophies)
- **Monthly Deflation:** Top 0.1% (Infinite 8,000+) reset to 5,000 trophies to prevent runaway leaders

**Trophy Milestones (Visual Feedback):**
- Every 100 trophies: Progress bar fills, visual celebration
- Division promotion: Badge upgrade animation, confetti
- Tier promotion: Full-screen celebration, unlock new border/cosmetics
- Infinite achievement: Global announcement, exclusive title

### 1.3 Promotion & Demotion

**Promotion Mechanics:**
- **Requirement:** Reach next division's trophy threshold
- **Immediate:** Promotion occurs instantly upon reaching threshold (no placement matches)
- **Visual:** Full-screen celebration, badge upgrade, unlock notification
- **Rewards:** Tier promotion grants DNA bonus + cosmetic + title

**Demotion Protection:**
- **Tier Floors:** Cannot drop below:
  - Bronze III (absolute floor for all players)
  - Silver III (achieved Gold once)
  - Gold III (achieved Platinum once)
  - Platinum III (achieved Diamond once)
- **Division Demotion:** Can drop divisions within tier freely (Silver I → Silver II → Silver III)
- **Grace Period:** First 3 losses after promotion don't trigger demotion (tilt protection)

**Psychological Design:**
- **Ratchet Effect:** Tier floors prevent "I lost all my progress" frustration
- **Division Fluidity:** Allows skill expression without harsh punishment
- **Infinite Safety:** Once Infinite, cannot demote (encourages aggressive play, risk-taking)

---

## 2. MMR & Matchmaking

### 2.1 Hidden MMR System

**Design Philosophy:** Visible rank (Bronze-Infinite) is for status. Hidden MMR is for fair matches.

**MMR Calculation:**
- **Starting MMR:** 1000 (neutral baseline)
- **Win Adjustment:** +30 MMR (base) × (1 + Trophy Differential / 100)
  - Beat higher MMR: +40 MMR
  - Beat equal MMR: +30 MMR
  - Beat lower MMR: +20 MMR
- **Loss Adjustment:** -25 MMR (base) × (1 + Trophy Differential / 100)
- **Confidence Factor:** First 20 games have 2× MMR swings (rapid calibration)

**MMR Ranges by Tier:**
| Tier | Expected MMR Range | Matchmaking Pool |
|------|-------------------|------------------|
| Bronze | 800-1,100 | Bronze (60% bots) |
| Silver | 1,000-1,300 | Silver + Bronze I |
| Gold | 1,200-1,600 | Gold + Silver I + Platinum III |
| Platinum | 1,500-2,000 | Platinum + Gold I + Diamond III |
| Diamond | 1,900-2,500 | Diamond + Platinum I + Infinite (low) |
| Infinite | 2,400+ | Infinite + Diamond I (if queue >30s) |

**MMR Decay:**
- **Purpose:** Prevent stale high-MMR accounts, encourage regular play
- **Decay Rate:** -10 MMR per day inactive (starts after 3 days)
- **Maximum Decay:** -200 MMR total (caps at 20 days inactivity)
- **Reset Protection:** Decay pauses during seasonal transitions (Week 1 of new season)

### 2.2 Matchmaking Algorithm

**Queue Process:**
1. **Player enters queue** (searches for opponent within MMR ± 50 range)
2. **Expand search every 5 seconds** (MMR ± 50 → ± 100 → ± 150 → ± 200)
3. **Bot fallback after 30 seconds** (if no human found, match with AI of similar MMR)
4. **Guarantee match within 60 seconds** (even if MMR difference is ± 300)

**Priority Factors:**
1. **MMR Similarity** (70% weight) - Closest MMR match preferred
2. **Latency** (20% weight) - Favor players in same region (NA, EU, APAC)
3. **Win Streak** (10% weight) - Avoid matching 5+ win streak against 5+ loss streak (tilt prevention)

**Bot Integration (Bronze-Silver Only):**
- **Bot Difficulty Scales with MMR:**
  - Bronze III (MMR 800-900): Easy bots (30s survival, 20 DNA avg)
  - Bronze I (MMR 1,000-1,100): Medium bots (45s survival, 40 DNA avg)
  - Silver III (MMR 1,100-1,200): Hard bots (60s survival, 60 DNA avg)
- **Bot Transparency:** Clearly labeled "AI Opponent" in match results (no deception)
- **Bot Graduation:** Gold+ is 100% human opponents (competitive integrity)

### 2.3 Smurf Prevention

**Problem:** Skilled players create new accounts to dominate low tiers (ruins new player experience).

**Detection Signals:**
1. **Performance Outliers:** Bronze player with 90s avg survival = suspicious
2. **Win Rate:** >70% win rate after 20 games = flag for review
3. **Trophy Velocity:** Climbing 500+ trophies in 10 games = rapid advancement
4. **Behavioral Patterns:** Identical playstyle to banned account (AI fingerprint analysis)

**Countermeasures:**
1. **Accelerated MMR:** Detected smurfs gain 3× MMR per win (rapidly exit low tiers)
2. **Tier Skipping:** After 10 wins in Bronze, auto-promote to Silver (skip Bronze grind)
3. **Reputation Score:** Accounts flagged for smurfing get -50% season rewards
4. **Permanent Ban:** Repeat offenders (3+ smurf accounts detected) = permanent device ban

**Phone Number Verification (Year 2+):**
- **Requirement:** Infinite rank requires phone verification (one account per phone)
- **Benefit:** Dramatically reduces smurf alt accounts
- **Trade-off:** Slight friction, but necessary for competitive integrity

### 3.3 Seasonal Meta Rotation

**Design Philosophy:** Each season should feel fresh. Rotate featured dynasties, buff underused variants, nerf dominants.

**Season Meta Design:**

**Season 1 Example: "CYBER Dominance"**
- **Featured Dynasty:** CYBER (all CYBER variants get +15% DNA collection bonus for entire season)
- **Balance Changes:**
  - CYBER-Alpha: +10% survival time (buff to encourage CYBER focus)
  - PRIMAL-Gamma: -5% DNA collection (nerf to prevent PRIMAL dominance)
  - COSMIC-Zeta: No changes (balanced)
- **New Mechanic:** "Dynasty Synergy" introduced (2 variants from same dynasty in loadout = +10% DNA)
- **Result:** 40% of competitive players use CYBER variants (healthy diversity with variety)

**Season 2 Example: "PRIMAL Resurgence"**
- **Featured Dynasty:** PRIMAL (all PRIMAL variants get +15% breeding cost reduction)
- **Balance Changes:**
  - PRIMAL-Omega: +15% DNA collection (buff previously underused variant)
  - CYBER-Alpha: -10% survival time (revert Season 1 buff, prevent permanent dominance)
  - COSMIC-Beta: +5% combo multiplier (encourage COSMIC experimentation)
- **New Mechanic:** "Generation Bonus" (Gen 5+ variants get +5% stats)
- **Result:** Meta shifts to PRIMAL focus, CYBER players adapt or switch

**Rotation Cadence:**
- **Bi-Weekly Balance Patches:** Small tweaks (2-4 variants adjusted)
- **Seasonal Major Patch:** Large meta shift (10-15 variants adjusted, new mechanics)
- **Community Feedback:** Reddit polls, Discord surveys, top player interviews inform changes

## 7. Meta Balance Philosophy

### 7.1 Data-Driven Balance

**Metrics Tracked (Weekly):**
1. **Play Rate:** % of competitive runs using each variant
2. **Win Rate:** % of runs resulting in top 50% trophy score for tier
3. **Breeding Rate:** % of players breeding each variant (prestige indicator)
4. **Combo Efficiency:** Avg combo achieved per variant
5. **DNA Efficiency:** DNA collected per second (economic balance)

**Red Flags (Triggers Balance Review):**
- **Play Rate >15%:** Variant too dominant (meta centralization)
- **Play Rate <1%:** Variant too weak (design failure)
- **Win Rate >55%:** Variant statistically overpowered
- **Win Rate <45%:** Variant statistically underpowered
- **Breeding Rate <0.5%:** Variant has no prestige value (rarity issue)

**Example (Season 2 Data):**
```
CYBER-Alpha:
- Play Rate: 18% (RED FLAG: Too dominant)
- Win Rate: 57% (RED FLAG: Overpowered)
- Breeding Rate: 8% (Healthy prestige)
→ Decision: Nerf -5% DNA collection, -10% survival time

PRIMAL-Omega:
- Play Rate: 2% (Underplayed)
- Win Rate: 43% (RED FLAG: Underpowered)
- Breeding Rate: 0.3% (RED FLAG: No prestige value)
→ Decision: Buff +10% DNA collection, +15% combo multiplier
```

### 7.2 Bi-Weekly Balance Patches

**Cadence:** Every 2 weeks (Monday patch day, aligns with content releases)

**Patch Structure:**
- **2-4 Buffs:** Underplayed/underpowered variants get stat increases
- **1-2 Nerfs:** Overplayed/overpowered variants get stat decreases
- **1 Experimental Change:** Test new mechanics (can be reverted if community backlash)

**Communication:**
- **Patch Notes:** Published 24 hours before patch (gives players time to adapt)
- **Reasoning:** Explain WHY changes made (data-driven, not arbitrary)
  - "CYBER-Alpha nerfed due to 57% win rate (target: 50%)"
  - "PRIMAL-Omega buffed due to 2% play rate (target: 5-10%)"
- **Community Input:** Reddit poll before patch ("Should we nerf CYBER-Alpha?")

**Example Patch Notes (Season 2, Week 4):**
```
BALANCE CHANGES:

Nerfs:
- CYBER-Alpha: DNA collection 18% → 13% (reason: 57% win rate, 18% play rate)
- COSMIC-Zeta: Survival time +10s → +5s (reason: 16% play rate, too safe)

Buffs:
- PRIMAL-Omega: DNA collection 10% → 20% (reason: 2% play rate, 43% win rate)
- VOID-Delta: Combo multiplier 1.1× → 1.3× (reason: 1% play rate, niche playstyle)

Experimental:
- NEW MECHANIC: "Risk Mode" - Activate mid-run for 2× DNA, but 1.5× difficulty
  (Testing player interest in high-risk/high-reward gameplay)
```

### 7.3 Community Feedback Integration

**Feedback Channels:**
1. **Reddit Polls:** Weekly poll on r/SupaSnake ("Which variant needs buff?")
2. **Discord Surveys:** Monthly meta survey (100+ responses required)
3. **Creator Interviews:** Quarterly interviews with top 10 creators (meta experts)
4. **Player Council:** 12-member advisory board (elected by community, meet monthly with devs)

**Feedback Loop:**
```
Week 1: Patch released
Week 2: Community feedback collected (Reddit, Discord, Twitter)
Week 3: Data analysis (play rates, win rates, sentiment)
Week 4: Next patch planned (balance changes based on data + feedback)
→ Repeat cycle
```

**Example (Community-Driven Change):**
```
Community Feedback: "PRIMAL-Gamma too weak, no one uses it"
Data: Play rate 1.2%, win rate 44%
Creator Input: "PRIMAL-Gamma has interesting mechanics but stats too low"
Player Council Vote: 10/12 vote to buff PRIMAL-Gamma

Result: Next patch buffs PRIMAL-Gamma +15% breeding cost reduction
Post-Patch: Play rate rises to 6%, win rate rises to 49%
Community Reaction: Positive ("Thanks for listening!")
```

## 8. Anti-Cheat & Fair Play

### 8.1 Client-Side Validation

**Input Speed Limits:**
- **Max Input Rate:** 10 inputs/second (prevent macro automation)
- **Input Pattern Detection:** Flag repetitive patterns (e.g., perfect circles every run = bot)
- **Impossible Scores:** Flag scores >3 standard deviations above tier avg (manual review)

**Device Fingerprinting:**
- **Hardware ID:** Track device UUID (detect multi-accounting)
- **Emulator Detection:** Flag emulator use (higher cheat risk, slower approval)
- **Root/Jailbreak Detection:** Warn players, reduce trust score

### 8.2 Server-Side Validation

**Run Data Cross-Reference:**
- **Expected DNA Range:** Validate DNA collected matches survival time + combo
  - 120s run, 30-combo → Expected DNA: 80-120 (variance allowed)
  - If DNA = 500 → Flag for review (impossible without cheat)
- **Physics Validation:** Validate snake movement speed, collision detection
  - If snake moves faster than max speed → Instant ban (speed hack)
- **Timeline Consistency:** Validate run events occur in logical order
  - If "DNA collected before food spawned" → Impossible, instant ban

**Replay Analysis (AI-Assisted):**
- **GPT-4 Behavioral Analysis:** Feed replay data to AI, flag "unnatural" patterns
  - Human players have variance (imperfect pathing, occasional mistakes)
  - Bots have perfect patterns (same pathing every run)
- **Manual Review Queue:** Flagged runs reviewed by human moderators (24-hour turnaround)

### 8.3 Leaderboard Integrity

**Top 100 Manual Review:**
- **Weekly Audit:** Every Sunday, review top 100 runs manually
- **Replay Verification:** Watch top 10 runs in full (15-20 min per run)
- **Community Reporting:** "Report" button on leaderboard (flags run for review)

**Penalties:**
- **First Offense (Suspicious):** 7-day competitive ban, -500 trophies
- **Second Offense (Confirmed Cheat):** Permanent competitive ban, all season rewards revoked
- **Third Offense (Repeat Cheater):** Permanent device ban, IP ban, account deletion

**Transparency:**
- **Ban Announcements:** Public Discord announcement for top 100 bans (deterrent)
- **Appeal Process:** Players can appeal ban (provide replay, manual review)

### 8.4 Exploit Prevention

**Economy Exploits:**
- **DNA Duplication:** Server-side DNA tracking (cannot earn more than physically possible)
- **Breeding Exploits:** Validate breeding costs paid, parents consumed
- **Gacha Exploits:** Pity timer server-side (cannot manipulate odds)

**Gameplay Exploits:**
- **Invincibility Glitches:** Server validates collision detection (cannot survive impossible hits)
- **Infinite Combo Glitches:** Server caps max combo at 99× (prevents integer overflow)

**Hotfix Protocol:**
- **Critical Exploits:** Emergency patch within 2 hours (disable feature if necessary)
- **Non-Critical Exploits:** Patch in next bi-weekly cycle
- **Compensation:** Players affected by exploits receive DNA compensation

## 9. Competitive Economy

### 9.1 Trophy-to-DNA Conversion

**Design Philosophy:** Competitive play should be rewarding economically, not just prestigiously.

**Conversion Rate:**
- **Every 100 trophies earned:** 500 DNA bonus
- **Seasonal Tier Rewards:** 500-50,000 DNA depending on tier (see Section 3.2)
- **Tournament Rewards:** 500-15,000 DNA per tournament (see Section 4.1)

**Example (Gold Player, One Season):**
```
Ranked Ladder:
- Climb from 0 → 1,500 trophies (Gold I)
- Trophy bonuses: 15× (1,500 / 100) × 500 DNA = 7,500 DNA
- Season reward (Gold): 5,000 DNA
= 12,500 DNA from ladder

Weekly Tournaments (12 weeks):
- Avg placement: Top 50 (2× base rewards)
- Avg reward: 6,000 DNA per tournament
= 72,000 DNA from tournaments

Total Competitive DNA: 84,500 DNA (vs ~113,100 DNA from casual F2P monthly income)
→ Competitive play is 75% as rewarding as casual grinding
```

**Competitive vs Casual DNA Efficiency:**
- **Casual:** 20 DNA/run × 30 runs/day = 600 DNA/day (1 hour play)
- **Competitive:** 330 trophies/run (Gold avg) = 1,650 DNA/run (trophy bonuses + tier rewards)
  - Efficiency: 1,650 DNA / 2 min run = 825 DNA per 2 min = **24,750 DNA/hour**
  - **Result:** Competitive is 41× more DNA-efficient than casual (but higher skill required)

### 9.2 Prestige Incentives (Platinum+ Exclusive Benefits)

**Design Philosophy:** Top-tier players deserve exclusive perks (cosmetic + economic).

**Platinum Tier Benefits:**
- **+10% DNA from all runs** (applies to both casual and competitive)
- **Breeding cost -15%** (faster prestige progression)
- **Exclusive Lab theme:** Platinum-themed UI customization
- **Priority matchmaking:** <5 second queue times (vs 15 second for lower tiers)

**Diamond Tier Benefits:**
- **+20% DNA from all runs**
- **Breeding cost -25%**
- **Exclusive cosmetics:** Diamond border, animated avatar
- **Creator code eligibility:** Can apply for creator revenue share

**Infinite Tier Benefits:**
- **+30% DNA from all runs** (massive economic advantage)
- **Breeding cost -35%**
- **Exclusive seasonal variant:** Only obtainable by reaching Infinite
- **Global recognition:** Featured in official news, social media

**Retention Impact:**
- **Platinum+ players:** 25% D30 retention (vs 8% for Bronze)
- **LTV:** $150 average (vs $25 for Bronze)
- **Revenue:** Platinum+ players represent 40% of total revenue (despite being 12% of player base)
