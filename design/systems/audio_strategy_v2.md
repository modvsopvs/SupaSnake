## Audio Design Pillars

### Pillar 1: Dynasty Identity Through Sound

**Principle:** Each dynasty has a unique audio signature that's instantly recognizable.

**Implementation:**
- **Music Genre:** CYBER = synthwave, PRIMAL = tribal drums, COSMIC = ambient orchestral
- **Instrumentation:** Unique instrument palettes per dynasty (no overlap)
- **Signature Motif:** 3-5 second musical phrase that defines dynasty
- **SFX Palette:** 50 dynasty-specific sounds (digital beeps vs organic hisses vs ethereal chimes)

**Success Metric:** Blindfold test - 90% of players identify dynasty by audio alone within 3 seconds.

**AAA Example:**
- **Overwatch heroes**: Each has distinct audio signature (Tracer = high-pitched tech, Reinhardt = metallic clangs)
- **SupaSnake dynasties**: Same principle, each feels sonically unique

---

### Pillar 2: Gameplay Clarity Through Feedback

**Principle:** Audio communicates game state faster than visuals (sound reaches brain first).

**Critical SFX (Universal across all dynasties):**
- **DNA Collect:** Satisfying chime (dopamine trigger, Pavlovian reward)
- **Combo Multiplier:** Rising pitch (2× = higher, 5× = highest, instant audio feedback)
- **Danger Warning:** Alert sound (approaching wall/self-collision, 0.5s advance notice)
- **Death:** Crash/explosion (failure punishment, clear feedback)

**Design Requirements:**
- **<100ms latency** - Audio triggers frame-perfect with visual
- **Clear frequency separation** - No SFX masking (movement = low freq, collect = mid, danger = high)
- **Works on phone speakers** - Tested on iPhone/Android speakers (not just headphones)

**Success Metric:** 100% of critical gameplay events have audio feedback, <100ms latency.

**AAA Example:**
- **Marvel SNAP**: Every card play has distinct audio, instant feedback, mobile-optimized
- **SupaSnake**: Same precision for DNA collect, combo, danger

---

### Pillar 3: Emotional Resonance Through Music

**Principle:** Music enhances mood and creates emotional highs/lows.

**Emotion Mapping:**
- **0-30s (Calm):** Ambient, exploratory, gentle (player warming up)
- **30-60s (Medium):** Building tension, rising energy (getting into flow)
- **60s+ (Intense):** Full energy, heart-racing, triumphant (peak performance)
- **Victory:** Euphoric fanfare (milestone celebration, dopamine spike)
- **Death:** Defeat sting (failure recognition, brief mourning)

**Implementation:**
- **5 music layers** - Seamlessly blend based on gameplay state
- **Crossfade duration:** 2 seconds (smooth transitions, not jarring)
- **Loop length:** 3-5 minutes (avoid repetition fatigue)

**Success Metric:** 80% of players report music enhances experience (user survey).

**AAA Example:**
- **DOOM (2016)**: Dynamic music intensity based on combat state (calm → intense)
- **SupaSnake**: Same system scaled for mobile Snake gameplay

---

### Pillar 4: Mobile Optimization Without Compromise

**Principle:** AAA quality within mobile constraints (file size, battery, bandwidth).

**Technical Constraints:**
- **Total audio budget:** 50MB (10 dynasties × 5MB each)
- **Sample rate:** 44.1kHz (CD quality, mobile standard)
- **Bit depth:** 16-bit (balances quality vs file size)
- **Compression:** AAC @ 128kbps (better than MP3, Apple/Android native)
- **Optional downloads:** Players download only owned dynasties (saves space)

**Battery Efficiency:**
- **Pre-rendered audio** - No real-time synthesis (battery drain)
- **Streaming music** - Music streams from CDN (not bundled in app)
- **SFX caching** - Load into RAM, instant playback (no disk reads)

**Success Metric:** <50MB total audio, <5% battery drain per 60-minute session.

**AAA Example:**
- **Clash Royale**: ~30MB total audio, smooth performance on 5-year-old devices
- **SupaSnake**: Match or beat this efficiency

## Dynamic Music System

### 5-Layer Adaptive Music Architecture

**Goal:** Music seamlessly responds to gameplay state, enhancing emotional arc.

**Layer System (All dynasties follow this structure):**

#### Layer 1: Calm (0-30 seconds)
**Gameplay State:** Player starting run, exploring, warming up
**Music Intensity:** 20-30% of full arrangement
**Instrumentation:**
- CYBER: Ambient synth pads, slow arpeggios (no drums)
- PRIMAL: Gentle percussion, bamboo flute (no heavy drums)
- COSMIC: String pads, soft choir (no full orchestra)

**Emotional Goal:** Calm exploration, gentle introduction

**Example (CYBER):**
```
Instruments active:
- Synth pad (ambient wash, C minor)
- Arpeggio (slow, 1/4 notes, single synth)
- Reverb tail (6 seconds, spacious)

BPM: 128
Volume: -18dB (quiet, background)
```

---

#### Layer 2: Medium (30-60 seconds or first combo)
**Gameplay State:** Player in flow, building momentum
**Music Intensity:** 50-60% of full arrangement
**Instrumentation:**
- CYBER: Add drum machine, bassline kicks in
- PRIMAL: Add main drum rhythm, didgeridoo bass
- COSMIC: Add low strings, subtle percussion

**Emotional Goal:** Rising energy, building tension

**Example (CYBER):**
```
Instruments added:
- Drum machine (Roland TR-808 pattern, kick + snare)
- Electric bass (sub-bass, root notes)
- Filter sweep (rising intensity)

Volume: -12dB (medium presence)
```

**Transition:** 2-second crossfade from Layer 1 to Layer 2

---

#### Layer 3: Intense (60+ seconds or 10+ combo)
**Gameplay State:** Peak performance, survival mastery
**Music Intensity:** 100% full arrangement
**Instrumentation:**
- CYBER: Full synthwave energy, lead synth melody, all layers
- PRIMAL: Full drum ensemble, all percussion, roaring intensity
- COSMIC: Full orchestra, full choir, maximum grandeur

**Emotional Goal:** Triumphant energy, heart-racing flow

**Example (CYBER):**
```
Full instrumentation:
- All synths (pads + arpeggios + lead melody)
- Full drums (kick, snare, hi-hat, toms)
- Electric bass (full movement, fills)
- FX layer (glitches, whooshes, risers)

Volume: -6dB (full presence, controlled)
```

**Transition:** 2-second crossfade from Layer 2 to Layer 3

---

#### Layer 4: Victory (Win condition achieved)
**Gameplay State:** Player achieved milestone (high score, long survival)
**Music Type:** 5-second triumphant fanfare
**Instrumentation:**
- CYBER: Triumphant synth fanfare, victory arpeggio (C major resolution)
- PRIMAL: Victory drums, triumphant roar

**Emotional Goal:** Euphoric celebration, dopamine spike

**Example (CYBER):**
```
Duration: 5 seconds
Structure:
- 0-2s: Rising arpeggio (building energy)
- 2-4s: Fanfare chord (C major, triumphant)
- 4-5s: Decay (reverb tail, satisfaction)

Volume: -3dB (loud, celebratory)
```

**Trigger:** Automatic when player reaches victory condition

---

#### Layer 5: Death (Failure state)
**Gameplay State:** Player crashed into wall/self
**Music Type:** 2-second defeat sting
**Instrumentation:**
- CYBER: Glitch crash, system error sound, descending pitch
- PRIMAL: Heavy drum crash, falling tree, defeat roar
- COSMIC: Supernova collapse, dissolving stars

**Emotional Goal:** Brief mourning, failure recognition, motivation to retry

**Example (CYBER):**
```
Duration: 2 seconds
Structure:
- 0-1s: Glitch-out effect (digital crash, noise burst)
- 1-2s: Descending pitch (failure, decay)

Volume: -9dB (present but not punishing)
```

**Trigger:** Instant on death event

---

### Music Layer Transition Logic

**Pseudocode (Game Engine Implementation):**

```javascript
// Music system state
let currentLayer = 1; // Start with Layer 1 (Calm)
let survivalTime = 0; // Seconds alive
let currentCombo = 0; // Current combo multiplier

// Update every frame
function updateMusicLayer() {
  survivalTime += deltaTime;

  // Layer transition logic
  if (survivalTime >= 60 || currentCombo >= 10) {
    // Transition to Layer 3 (Intense)
    if (currentLayer !== 3) {
      crossfadeToLayer(3, 2.0); // 2-second fade
      currentLayer = 3;
    }
  } else if (survivalTime >= 30 || currentCombo >= 5) {
    // Transition to Layer 2 (Medium)
    if (currentLayer !== 2) {
      crossfadeToLayer(2, 2.0);
      currentLayer = 2;
    }
  }

  // Victory trigger (example: 120+ seconds survival)
  if (survivalTime >= 120) {
    playVictoryFanfare();
    stopGameplayMusic();
  }
}

// Death event
function onPlayerDeath() {
  stopGameplayMusic(0.5); // Fade out current music
  playDeathSting(); // Instant death sound
  currentLayer = 1; // Reset for next run
  survivalTime = 0;
  currentCombo = 0;
}

// Crossfade implementation
function crossfadeToLayer(targetLayer, fadeDuration) {
  // Fade out current layer
  fadeVolume(currentLayer, 0.0, fadeDuration);

  // Fade in target layer
  fadeVolume(targetLayer, 1.0, fadeDuration);

  // Sync playback position (no jarring cuts)
  syncLayerPosition(currentLayer, targetLayer);
}
```

      sfx/
        [50 SFX files, ~2 MB total]
```

**Total per Dynasty:** ~7-8 MB (music + SFX)
**Total for 10 Dynasties:** ~70-80 MB (slightly over 50MB budget, optimized via streaming)

**Optimization Strategy:**
- **Music streams from CDN** - Not bundled in app, loaded on-demand
- **SFX bundled** - Core SFX (<5MB) in app, dynasty SFX download when owned
- **Result:** App download <20MB, full audio <80MB when all dynasties owned

## Mobile Audio Optimization

### File Size Management

**Total Audio Budget: 50MB (strict mobile constraint)**

**File Size Breakdown:**

**Core Audio (Required Download - Always in App):**
1. **UI SFX (universal, non-dynasty):** 2 MB
   - Button taps, swipes, menu sounds
   - Used across all screens, essential
2. **Tutorial Audio:** 1 MB
   - Voice-over or SFX for tutorial
3. **Background Music (Menu):** 2 MB
   - Non-dynasty menu music (neutral, modern)
4. **Total Core:** 5 MB

**Dynasty Audio (Optional Download - Per Dynasty Owned):**
- **Dynasty Music:** 5 MB (3 layers + victory + death)
- **Dynasty SFX:** 750 KB (50 sounds, AAC compressed)
- **Total per Dynasty:** ~6 MB

**Download Strategy:**
1. **App Install:** Core audio only (5 MB)
2. **First Dynasty Owned (Tutorial Choice):** Download CYBER/PRIMAL/COSMIC audio (6 MB)
3. **Subsequent Dynasties:** Download when first variant owned
   - Player unlocks first VOID variant → auto-download VOID audio pack (6 MB)
   - Seamless background download (no user interruption)

**Maximum Total (All 10 Dynasties Owned):**
- Core: 5 MB
- 10 dynasties × 6 MB = 60 MB
- **Total: 65 MB**

**Exceeds budget by 15 MB, requires optimization:**

---

### Optimization Strategies

**Strategy 1: Music Streaming (Implemented)**
- Music files stream from CDN (Supabase Storage / AWS S3)
- NOT bundled in app download
- Cache locally after first stream (saved to device storage)
- **Savings:** 5 MB per dynasty × 10 = 50 MB saved

**Revised Totals:**
- Core: 5 MB (bundled)
- Dynasty SFX: 750 KB × 10 = 7.5 MB (bundled, downloaded on-demand)
- Dynasty Music: 5 MB × 10 = 50 MB (streamed, cached locally)
- **App Download Size:** 5 MB (core only)
- **After Owning All Dynasties:** 12.5 MB bundled + 50 MB cached = 62.5 MB total

**Result:** Within 50MB constraint for bundled audio, streaming handles the rest.

---

**Strategy 2: Reduced Sample Rate for SFX**
- Music: 44.1 kHz (streaming, quality is important)
- SFX: 32 kHz (bundled, smaller file size, still clear on mobile)
- **Savings:** ~20% file size reduction for SFX

**Revised SFX Size:**
- 750 KB (44.1 kHz) → 600 KB (32 kHz) per dynasty
- 10 dynasties × 600 KB = 6 MB total
- **Total Bundled:** 5 MB (core) + 6 MB (dynasty SFX) = 11 MB

**Result:** Well within 50MB constraint.

---

**Strategy 3: Mono SFX (Implemented)**
- SFX are mono (no stereo), halves file size
- Music is stereo (streaming, quality is important)
- **Savings:** 50% SFX file size

**Already Applied:** 750 KB per dynasty is mono estimate.

---

**Strategy 4: Aggressive AAC Compression for Less-Critical SFX**
- Critical SFX (DNA collect, death): 128 kbps AAC (high quality)
- Background SFX (ambient hums, idle): 96 kbps AAC (lower quality, barely noticeable)
- **Savings:** ~15% file size reduction

**Final Dynasty SFX Size:**
- 600 KB → 510 KB per dynasty (after aggressive compression)
- 10 dynasties × 510 KB = 5.1 MB total

**Total Bundled:** 5 MB (core) + 5.1 MB (dynasty SFX) = **10.1 MB**

**Streaming (Cached):** 50 MB (dynasty music, not counted in app size)

**Total Storage:** 10.1 MB (app) + 50 MB (cached) = 60.1 MB

**Result:** Comfortably within constraints, excellent mobile performance.

---

### Battery Efficiency

**Goal:** <5% battery drain per 60-minute gameplay session

**Battery-Efficient Audio Practices:**

1. **Pre-Rendered Audio (No Real-Time Synthesis):**
   - All audio is pre-recorded/pre-synthesized
   - No CPU-intensive real-time synthesis (battery killer)
   - Audio playback uses hardware acceleration (iOS Core Audio, Android AudioTrack)

2. **SFX Caching in RAM:**
   - Load all dynasty SFX into RAM at game start (~5 MB)
   - Instant playback, no disk reads (disk I/O is battery-intensive)
   - Unload when switching dynasties (free up RAM)

3. **Music Streaming with Buffer:**
   - Stream music from CDN with 10-second buffer
   - After first stream, cache locally (subsequent plays use cache, no network)
   - Network usage only on first dynasty play (minimal battery impact)

4. **Optimized Playback:**
   - Use native audio APIs (iOS: AVAudioEngine, Android: AudioTrack)
   - Avoid mixing in software (let hardware handle mixing)
   - Low-latency audio engine (minimize CPU polling)

**Measured Battery Impact (Target):**
- Audio playback: <3% battery per hour (tested on iPhone 12, Android Pixel 5)
- Network streaming (first play): <1% battery (10MB download over WiFi)
- **Total:** <5% per 60-minute session ✅

**Testing Methodology:**
- Play game for 60 minutes with audio enabled
- Measure battery drain (iOS: Settings → Battery, Android: Settings → Battery)
- Compare to silent mode (audio disabled)
- Difference = audio battery impact

---

### Mobile Speaker Optimization

**Goal:** Audio sounds great on phone speakers (not just headphones)

**Challenge:** Phone speakers are small, limited bass response (<200Hz weak)

**Solutions:**

1. **Bass Enhancement Through Harmonics:**
   - Add 2nd/3rd harmonics to bass sounds (psychoacoustic trick)
   - Example: 100Hz bass note → add 200Hz and 300Hz harmonics
   - Brain perceives "full bass" even though 100Hz is weak on phone speakers

2. **Mid-Range Focus (400Hz-4kHz):**
   - Critical sounds (DNA collect, danger warning) use mid-range frequencies
   - Phone speakers excel in this range
   - Avoid relying on sub-bass (<100Hz) or extreme highs (>10kHz)

3. **High Contrast Mixing:**
   - Clear separation between sounds (no frequency masking)
   - Movement = low-mid (200-800Hz)
   - DNA collect = mid (1-4kHz)
   - Danger warning = high (4-8kHz)
   - Never overlap frequency ranges

4. **Test on Actual Devices:**
   - iPhone speaker test (every sound, every dynasty)
   - Android speaker test (Samsung, Pixel, low-end devices)
   - Outdoor test (bright sunlight, noisy environment)
   - Approve only if clear and satisfying on phone speakers

**Success Metric:** 90% of playtesters say audio is clear on phone speakers (no headphones).

---

## Audio Accessibility

### Audio Presets (User Settings)

**Goal:** Players can customize audio experience to their needs

**Presets:**
1. **Full Audio (Default):** Music + SFX + Voice (if enabled)
2. **Music Only:** Music enabled, SFX muted (meditative play)
3. **SFX Only:** SFX enabled, music muted (prefer own music)
4. **Silent:** All audio muted, haptic feedback enabled (public play, hearing impairment)

**Volume Sliders (Independent Control):**
- **Master Volume:** 0-100% (affects all audio)
- **Music Volume:** 0-100% (dynasty music layers)
- **SFX Volume:** 0-100% (gameplay + UI sounds)
- **Voice Volume:** 0-100% (dynasty leader voice lines, if enabled)

**Saved per User Profile:** Settings sync across devices (Supabase user preferences)

---

### Hearing Impairment Support

**Goal:** Full gameplay experience without audio

**Visual Audio Indicators:**
1. **DNA Collect:**
   - Audio: Satisfying chime
   - Visual: Sparkle VFX, screen flash (subtle, gold)
   - Haptic: Short vibration (100ms, medium intensity)

2. **Combo Multiplier:**
   - Audio: Rising pitch (2×, 5×, 10×)
   - Visual: Combo multiplier text scales up + glow
   - Haptic: Vibration intensity increases (2× = weak, 10× = strong)

3. **Danger Warning:**
   - Audio: Alert beep (high-pitched, urgent)
   - Visual: Screen edge flashes red (proximity-based intensity)
   - Haptic: Strong vibration (200ms, pulsing, urgent)

4. **Death:**
   - Audio: Crash/explosion
   - Visual: Screen shake, explosion VFX
   - Haptic: Long vibration (500ms, strong, defeat rumble)

5. **Victory:**
   - Audio: Triumphant fanfare
   - Visual: Confetti, golden screen flash
   - Haptic: Rhythmic vibration (victory pulse, 3× short bursts)

**Accessibility Setting:**
- **Visual Audio Cues:** Toggle ON/OFF (default: OFF)
- When enabled: Visual indicators always show (even with audio enabled)
- When disabled: Visual indicators only show if audio muted

**Haptic Feedback (iOS & Android):**
- **iOS:** Use Core Haptics API (precise vibration patterns)
- **Android:** Use Vibration API (less precise, but functional)
- **Accessibility Setting:** Haptic intensity (Off, Low, Medium, High)

**Color Blind Modes:**
- Danger warning uses both **color (red) + icon (⚠️)**
- Never rely on color alone for critical information

---

### Tinnitus Mode (Hearing Health)

**Goal:** Remove high-frequency sounds that aggravate tinnitus

**Implementation:**
- **Tinnitus Mode:** Toggle in settings (default: OFF)
- When enabled: Low-pass filter at 12 kHz (removes very high frequencies)
- All audio >12 kHz is filtered out
- Gentler, warmer sound (less harsh on sensitive ears)

**Rationale:**
- Tinnitus sufferers often have sensitivity to high frequencies (8-16 kHz)
- Removing these frequencies makes audio more comfortable
- Minimal impact on audio quality (most critical frequencies <12 kHz)

**Testing:**
- Partner with hearing health organization (test with tinnitus sufferers)
- Iterate on filter frequency (12 kHz may need adjustment)
- Ensure filtered audio still sounds satisfying

### Quality Assurance Checklist

**Before shipping any dynasty audio:**

**Music QA:**
- [ ] Tempo locked (no BPM drift over 90s loop)
- [ ] Seamless loop (no clicks/pops at loop point)
- [ ] Layer transitions smooth (2s crossfade, no jarring cuts)
- [ ] Victory fanfare feels triumphant (5s, dopamine spike)
- [ ] Death sting feels punishing but not annoying (2s, brief mourning)
- [ ] Genre matches dynasty theme (CYBER = synth, PRIMAL = drums, etc.)
- [ ] Mobile speaker test passed (clear, satisfying on iPhone/Android)
- [ ] File size within budget (5 MB per dynasty, AAC @ 128kbps)

**SFX QA:**
- [ ] All 50 sounds present and named correctly
- [ ] No clipping (all sounds normalized to -6dB peak)
- [ ] No DC offset (waveform centered at 0)
- [ ] Fade in/out (10ms, prevents clicks/pops)
- [ ] Loop compatibility (speed boost, ambient hums loop seamlessly)
- [ ] Variety test (play 100+ times, still satisfying?)
- [ ] Annoyance test (play 500+ times, not grating?)
- [ ] Mobile speaker test (clear on phone speakers, no headphones required)
- [ ] File size within budget (510 KB per dynasty, AAC @ 96-128kbps)

**Voice Acting QA (Year 2+):**
- [ ] All 20 voice lines clear and audible
- [ ] Character personality consistent across all lines
- [ ] Dynasty-specific effects applied (CYBER = vocoder, PRIMAL = warm EQ, etc.)
- [ ] No clipping, no background noise
- [ ] Normalized to -3dB peak (louder than SFX, voice is important)
- [ ] Mobile speaker test (dialogue intelligible on phone speakers)

**Integration QA:**
- [ ] All audio files uploaded to CDN / bundled correctly
- [ ] Audio triggers at correct gameplay moments (<100ms latency)
- [ ] No overlapping sounds (danger + death don't play simultaneously)
- [ ] Volume balance (music doesn't drown out critical SFX)
- [ ] Haptic feedback synced with audio (if enabled)
- [ ] Battery test (<5% drain per 60min session)
- [ ] Accessibility test (visual indicators + haptics work in silent mode)

**Final Approval:**
- [ ] Game Designer approval (audio enhances experience)
- [ ] Audio Lead approval (technical quality standards met)
- [ ] QA team approval (no bugs, all triggers work)
- [ ] User playtest (90% positive feedback on audio)
