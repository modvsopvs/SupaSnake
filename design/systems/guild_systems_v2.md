## Executive Summary

**Guilds are SupaSnake's retention engine. Solo players have 15% D30 retention. Guild members have 35% D30 retention. That 2.3× multiplier is the difference between indie hobby and $40M ARR business.**

This document specifies the complete guild ecosystem:
- **Guild Core:** 50-member communities with progression (Level 1-50)
- **Guild Wars:** Weekly competitive events (Thursday-Monday, 96 hours)
- **Guild Raids:** Monthly co-op PvE boss fights (48-hour events)
- **Trading System:** Peer-to-peer variant exchange (guild-only v1.0, fraud prevention)
- **Anti-Toxicity:** Opt-in PvP, accountability systems, AI moderation

**Design Philosophy:** Social systems that increase retention without toxicity. Async-first for mobile. Cooperative > competitive. Guilds build community, not stress.

**Key Metrics:**
- 60% of D30 players in active guilds by Month 2
- 40% guild war participation rate (weekly)
- 25% trading activity rate (monthly)
- <2% report rate (toxicity stays low)
- 2.3× retention multiplier for guild members vs solo

## III. Guild Wars (Competitive Weekly Event)

### 3.1 Event Structure

**Timing:**
- **Start:** Thursday 12:00 PM PST
- **End:** Monday 12:00 PM PST
- **Duration:** 96 hours (4 days)
- **Frequency:** Every week (52 wars/year)

**Opt-In Registration:**
- Guilds register Wednesday (24-hour window)
- Matchmaking Thursday 12:00 PM
- War begins immediately after matchmaking

**Participation:**
- Voluntary (guilds not participating skip the week, no penalty)
- Recommended: 30+ active members for competitive viability

### 3.2 Matchmaking Algorithm

**Tier 1: Guild Level (±2 Levels)**
- Level 15 guild matches with Level 13-17 guilds
- Prevents Level 50 guilds stomping Level 5 guilds

**Tier 2: War Elo Rating**
- Each guild has hidden Elo (starts at 1500)
- Win = +20 Elo, Loss = -15 Elo
- Matchmaking prioritizes similar Elo (±50 points)

**Tier 3: Active Member Count (±10 Members)**
- 50-member guild matches with 40-50 member guilds
- Prevents 20-member guilds competing with 50-member behemoths

**Tier 4: Region/Time Zone (Preferred)**
- NA guilds match with NA guilds when possible
- Ensures war peaks align (Saturday primetime)

**Matchmaking Priority:**
1. Guild Level (hard constraint)
2. Elo Rating (preferred)
3. Member Count (soft constraint)
4. Region (nice-to-have)

**Edge Cases:**
- No match found after 5 minutes → expand search (±3 levels, ±100 Elo)
- Still no match → PvE war mode (guild vs AI benchmark score)

### 3.3 Scoring System

**Primary Metric: Total DNA Collected**
- Sum of all members' DNA during war period (Thursday 12 PM → Monday 12 PM)
- Only Snake runs count (Classic Mode + Tower Mode)
- Energy refills encouraged (IAP opportunity during wars)

**Individual Contribution:**
- Each member's best 10 runs count (not total, prevents no-life grinding)
- Example: Player completes 50 runs, top 10 = 25,000 DNA → contributes 25,000 to guild total
- **Result:** 5 hours of peak gameplay (10 runs) contributes fully (prevents burnout)

**Participation Bonus Multiplier:**
- 50-79% members participate (25-39 players): 1.0× (base)
- 80-89% members participate (40-44 players): 1.1× total DNA
- 90-99% members participate (45-49 players): 1.15× total DNA
- 100% members participate (50/50 players): 1.25× total DNA

**Formula:**
```
Guild Score = (Sum of Top 10 Runs per Member) × Participation Multiplier

Example:
Guild A: 48 members participate (96%)
Total DNA (raw): 1,200,000
Participation Multiplier: 1.15×
Final Score: 1,380,000 DNA

Guild B: 50 members participate (100%)
Total DNA (raw): 1,300,000
Participation Multiplier: 1.25×
Final Score: 1,625,000 DNA

Winner: Guild B (better participation = higher multiplier)
```

**Individual Milestones (Bonus to Guild Score):**
- 10,000 DNA: +5,000 bonus to guild score
- 50,000 DNA: +20,000 bonus
- 100,000 DNA: +50,000 bonus
- **Purpose:** Reward hardcore grinders without making war purely about them

## IV. Guild Raids (Co-op PvE)

### 4.1 Event Structure

**Frequency:**
- First weekend of every 3rd month (Month 3, 6, 9, 12)
- 48-hour event (Saturday 12 PM → Monday 12 PM)
- **Annual:** 4 raid weekends per year

**Boss Design:**
- AI-controlled mega-snake with 1,000,000 HP
- Three phases (each 333,333 HP):
  - **Phase 1 (0-33% HP):** Normal difficulty, no hazards
  - **Phase 2 (33-66% HP):** Medium difficulty, environmental hazards (lava flows, ice walls)
  - **Phase 3 (66-100% HP):** Hard difficulty, boss attacks (screen shake, obstacle spawns)

**Damage Calculation:**
```
Damage = DNA Collected × 10

Example:
Player completes run: 500 DNA collected
Damage dealt to boss: 5,000 HP

Guild (50 members, 10 runs each):
Average DNA: 400 per run
Total runs: 500 runs (50 members × 10 runs)
Total DNA: 200,000 DNA
Total damage: 2,000,000 HP → Boss defeated (1M HP threshold)
```

**Victory Condition:**
- Boss HP reduced to 0 within 48 hours
- All participating members receive rewards
- Boss HP shared globally across guild (persistent)

### 4.2 Boss Mechanics & Strategy

**Phase Transitions:**
- Boss enters Phase 2 at 666,666 HP remaining
  - New hazard: Lava flows (blocks certain paths)
  - Guild chat coordination: "Everyone switch to INFERNO variants (fire immunity)!"
- Boss enters Phase 3 at 333,333 HP remaining
  - New hazard: Ice walls (freezes snake for 1 second)
  - Boss attacks: Screen shake disrupts timing

**Optimal Strategy:**
- Early game (Phase 1): Max DNA grinding (no defensive variants needed)
- Mid game (Phase 2): Adapt to hazards (fire-resistant variants, careful pathing)
- Late game (Phase 3): High-skill runs (veteran players carry, casuals contribute volume)

**Guild Coordination:**
- Officers post strategy in guild chat
- Veterans mentor newer players
- Everyone contributes (casuals do volume, hardcore do big damage runs)

### 4.3 Rewards

**Victory (Boss Defeated):**

**All Participants (10+ Runs):**
- Mythic cosmetic (unique boss-themed skin, e.g., "Inferno Demon Skin")
- Epic Pod
- 5,000 DNA

**Participation (5-9 Runs):**
- Rare Pod
- 2,000 DNA

**MVP (Top 3 Damage Dealers):**
- +1 Legendary Pod (bonus)
- "Raid Champion" title (permanent)
- Exclusive guild banner pattern (boss-themed)

**Defeat (Boss Survives):**
- Participation rewards only (Rare Pod for 5+ runs)
- No mythic cosmetic (creates FOMO for next raid)

**Guild Progression:**
- Victory: 10,000 guild XP
- Defeat: 5,000 guild XP (participation still valued)

5. Both confirm (irreversible after confirmation)
6. Trade executes instantly

**Fair Trade Warnings:**
```
⚠️ Trade Warning
You are offering: CYBER-Alpha (Epic)

- Warns if trade is >3× imbalanced

**2. Trade History Tracking:**
- All trades logged (visible to officers)
- Suspicious patterns flagged (player receives 10 Epics in 1 day)
- Officers can investigate (view trade history)

**3. Reputation System:**
- Players rate trades: "Fair Trade" or "Report as Scam"
- 5+ scam reports → account flagged for review
- 10+ scam reports → auto-ban pending investigation

**4. Guild Accountability:**
- If guild has 5+ trade disputes in 30 days → guild warning
- 10+ disputes → guild skips next war
- 20+ disputes → guild disbanded (extreme measure, rarely needed)

**AI Monitoring:**

- Guild Wars: Voluntary registration (guilds choose to participate)
- Friend Battles: Send challenges (don't force competition)
- Leaderboards: View if interested (doesn't gate content)
- Trading: Initiate yourself (no forced economy participation)

**Solo Viability:**
- 100% of core content accessible solo
- Guilds = bonus retention/fun, not requirement
- No FOMO for solo players (all variants eventually available)

### 7.2 Mute/Block Tools

**Instant Control:**
- Mute specific guild member (no notification sent)
- Mute entire guild chat (personal peace)
- Block player (prevents all interaction: trades, chat, friend requests)
- Block list: Max 100 players

**Privacy:**
- Blocked players never notified (prevents retaliation)
- System shows "Player unavailable for trade" (ambiguous)

### 7.3 Report System

**5 Report Categories:**
1. **Harassment:** Bullying, threats, hate speech
2. **Spam:** Flooding chat, unwanted trade spam
3. **Cheating:** Exploits, hacks, botting
4. **Scamming:** Trade fraud, fake offers
5. **Inappropriate Content:** NSFW, offensive names

**Escalating Penalties:**
1. Warning (first offense)
2. 24-hour chat ban (second offense)
3. 7-day chat/trading ban (third offense)
4. 30-day chat/trading ban (fourth offense)
5. Permanent ban (fifth offense or severe cases)

**Severe Cases (Immediate Action):**
- Hate speech: Instant 7-day ban
- Threats/doxxing: Instant 30-day ban + law enforcement referral
- Repeated severe offenses: Permanent account ban

### 7.4 AI Moderation

**Chat Filtering:**
- Profanity filter (configurable by guild: off/medium/strict)
- Slur detection (always active, cannot be disabled)
- Spam detection (repeated messages flagged)
- Link blocking (phishing prevention)

**AI Escalation:**
- GPT-4 analyzes flagged messages
- Context-aware (distinguishes banter from harassment)
- Escalates to human review if uncertain
- Encrypted storage (30-day retention for appeals)

### 7.5 Positive Reinforcement

**Kudos System:**
- Give "Kudos" to friendly players (post-trade, post-raid)
- Limit: 5 kudos given per day (prevents spam)
- **Milestones:**
  - 50 kudos: "Friendly Player" badge
  - 100 kudos: Priority guild invites (guilds see kudos score)
  - 500 kudos: "Community Hero" title + 5,000 DNA reward

**Positive Chat Rewards:**

---

## VIII. Guild Onboarding

### 8.1 When Guilds Unlock

**Level 5 Unlock (Day 2-3):**
- Player reaches Level 5 (proven engagement)
- Notification: "Guilds Unlocked! Join a community and earn bonuses."
- Tutorial: 30-second explainer (what guilds are, benefits, how to join)

**Why Delay?**
- New players overwhelmed by features (focus on core loop first)
- Need time to understand game (breeding, collection, energy)
- Prevents premature guild pressure (join immediately or fall behind)

### 8.2 Guild Discovery

- **Faster progression:** Level 50 in 12 months (vs 2+ years in CoC)
- **More frequent wars:** Weekly (vs 2-3 times per week in CoC)

**Similarities:**
- Clan Wars (seasonal competitive) ✅
- Donation system ✅
- Chat + emotes ✅
- Trophy-based matchmaking (≈ Elo) ✅

**SupaSnake Improvements:**
- **Async-first:** No real-time pressure (better for mobile)
- **Co-op raids:** PvE content (not just PvP)
- **Trading economy:** P2P variant exchange (CR has none)
- **Guild levels:** More progression depth (50 levels vs CR's ~10)

- Voice chat (real-time communication)

### 10.4 Summary: Best-in-Class Hybrid

**SupaSnake Guild Systems = Clash of Clans structure + Clash Royale frequency + Destiny 2 raids, optimized for async mobile.**

**Key Innovations:**
