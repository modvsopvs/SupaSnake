# Breeding System v2.0 - SupaSnake AAA
## Fair Gacha Meets Infinite Prestige

**Document Version:** 2.0
**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Status:** PRODUCTION SPECIFICATION
**Dependencies:** Supercell Monetization Study, Monetization Architecture AAA, Progression Systems AAA
**Philosophy:** Transparent odds, guaranteed outcomes, infinite vertical climb

---

## Executive Summary

Breeding v2.0 transforms SupaSnake from deterministic breeding (v1.0) into a **fair gacha system** with **infinite prestige mechanics**, combining Supercell's proven monetization psychology with roguelike depth. This is the 70% core loop - breeding is not a side activity, it's the game.

### Core Transformation

**v1.0 Model (Deterministic):**
- Parent A + Parent B = Predictable offspring
- No randomness, pure strategy
- **Problem:** Shallow depth, solvable meta, 2-month ceiling

**v2.0 Model (Fair Gacha + Prestige):**
- Parents determine egg rarity → Hatching determines variant (gacha)
- Pity system prevents infinite bad luck (guaranteed rare every 100 eggs)
- Generation system enables Gen 1 → Gen ∞ (never-ending climb)
- **Result:** Infinite progression, F2P viable, whale-friendly acceleration

### Design Pillars

1. **Fair Gacha, Not Exploitative** - Transparent odds, pity guarantees, no gambling addiction triggers
2. **Infinite Progression** - Gen 1 → Gen ∞ (years of vertical climb for hardcore players)
3. **The Lab is the Game** - Breeding is 70% of playtime, not a side feature
4. **F2P Generosity** - 15-20 Legendary variants/year for casual F2P, 40-50 for hardcore

### Revenue Impact

- **DNA Pod System:** 15-20% of total revenue ($80-120k/month Year 1)
- **Breeding Economics:** DNA costs balanced for $5-8 ARPU
- **Pity System:** Builds trust, drives long-term retention (50%+ D30 target)
- **Prestige Mechanics:** Infinite whale spending (Gen 50+ breeding costs millions of DNA)

## 1. Breeding Core Loop

### Step-by-Step Flow

**Step 1: Select Parents (2 Snakes Required)**

Player navigates to Breeding Lab UI, sees 4 breeding slots:

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  BREEDING LAB                                  │
│  Active Breeds: 1/4                            │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Slot 1: [CYBER-Alpha ♂] + [CYBER-Beta ♀]    │
│          Status: Incubating (2h 47m remaining) │
│          Egg: Rare Egg (hatches Epic+ likely) │
│                                                │
│  Slot 2: [Empty] + [Empty]                    │
│          [Select Parents] button               │
│                                                │
│  Slot 3: [LOCKED - Breeder's Journal Tier 2]  │
│  Slot 4: [LOCKED - Premium Purchase $4.99]    │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Parent Selection Criteria:**
- Both parents must be from collection (owned variants)
- Parents consumed in breeding (permanent sacrifice)
- Parents determine egg rarity tier (common + common = common egg, rare + rare = rare egg)
- Cross-dynasty breeding allowed (v1.0+), creates hybrid traits

**UI Flow:**
1. Tap Slot 2 "Select Parents"
2. Choose Parent A from collection (filters: dynasty, generation, rarity)
3. Choose Parent B from collection
4. Preview egg rarity: "Rare + Rare = 90% Rare Egg, 9% Epic Egg, 1% Legendary Egg"
5. Confirm: "Sacrifice parents and begin breeding?"
6. DNA cost shown: "Cost: 2,000 DNA (Rare breeding)"

**Step 2: Incubate Egg (Time Gate)**

**Incubation Timers:**

| Egg Rarity | Incubation Time | DNA Cost to Skip | Use Case |
|------------|-----------------|------------------|----------|
| Common Egg | 2 hours | 100 DNA ($0.50) | Fast breeding, F2P friendly |
| Rare Egg | 6 hours | 300 DNA ($1.50) | Medium investment |
| Epic Egg | 12 hours | 600 DNA ($3.00) | Overnight breeding |
| Legendary Egg | 24 hours | 1,200 DNA ($6.00) | Multi-day commitment |
| Mythic Egg | 48 hours | 2,400 DNA ($12.00) | Ultimate prestige |

**Timer Mechanics:**
- Egg sits in breeding slot during incubation
- Slot locked until hatch (can't start new breed)
- Timer continues offline (respects player time)
- Visual: Egg glows, cracks appear as timer nears completion

**Skip Options:**
1. **Breeding Token (F2P Earnable):**
   - Instantly completes any incubation
   - Earned: 1-2 tokens/day (daily quests, pod drops)
   - F2P players can skip 1-2 timers daily (generous)

2. **DNA Instant Unlock (Premium):**
   - Cost scales with timer (100 DNA per hour remaining)
   - Example: 12h Epic egg with 6h left = 600 DNA to instant-hatch
   - Whales can accelerate collection (pay for time, not power)

3. **VIP Subscription Perk:**
   - 1 free instant breeding token/day
   - 4th breeding slot permanent (vs. seasonal for Battle Pass)

**Step 3: Hatch Egg (Gacha Moment)**

**Hatching Ceremony (5-15 Second Animation):**

1. **Egg Reveal (2s):** Egg cracks, glows with rarity color (blue = rare, purple = epic, gold = legendary)
2. **Rarity Tier Reveal (3s):** Text appears: "Rare Variant!" with particle effects
3. **Variant Reveal (5s):** Snake emerges from egg, scales shimmer, traits display
4. **Stat Showcase (3s):** Stats appear (speed, DNA multiplier, survival bonus), generation shown
5. **Collection Update (2s):** "Added to Collection: CYBER-Gamma (Gen 2)" + confetti

**Hatching Odds (Based on Egg Rarity):**

**Common Egg:**
- 90% Common variant
- 9% Rare variant
- 0.9% Epic variant
- 0.1% Legendary variant
- 0% Mythic variant

**Rare Egg:**
- 70% Rare variant
- 25% Epic variant
- 4.5% Legendary variant
- 0.5% Mythic variant

**Epic Egg:**
- 60% Epic variant
- 35% Legendary variant
- 5% Mythic variant

**Legendary Egg:**
- 70% Legendary variant
- 30% Mythic variant

**Mythic Egg:**
- 100% Mythic variant (guaranteed)

**Pity System (Anti-Gambling):**
- **Guaranteed Rare:** Every 100 eggs hatched without rare+ → next egg guaranteed rare+
- **Guaranteed Legendary:** Every 500 eggs hatched without legendary → next egg guaranteed legendary
- **Pity Counter Visible:** "147 eggs since last Legendary (guaranteed at 500)"
- **Transparency:** Exact % shown before hatching ("This Rare Egg has 70% chance of Rare, 25% Epic, 4.5% Legendary, 0.5% Mythic")

**Step 4: Result & Next Action**

**Post-Hatch Options:**

1. **Add to Collection:** Snake added to roster, can be used in Classic Mode, breeding
2. **Quick Breed:** Instantly start new breed with this snake as parent
3. **Re-roll (1 per egg):** Reject result, return parents (50% DNA refund), try again
   - Cost: Forfeit egg, lose parents permanently, refund 50% DNA
   - Use case: Got common from rare egg (bad luck), want to re-roll
   - Limit: 1 re-roll per egg (prevents infinite gambling)

4. **Prestige Breed:** If both parents Gen 10+, unlock prestige options (see Section 4)

---

## 2. Egg Gacha System (Fair, Not Exploitative)

### Egg Rarity Determination

**Parent Rarity → Egg Rarity Table:**

| Parent A | Parent B | Egg Outcome | % Chance |
|----------|----------|-------------|----------|
| Common | Common | Common Egg | 95% |
| | | Rare Egg | 5% |
| Common | Rare | Common Egg | 60% |
| | | Rare Egg | 39% |
| | | Epic Egg | 1% |
| Rare | Rare | Rare Egg | 80% |
| | | Epic Egg | 19% |
| | | Legendary Egg | 1% |
| Epic | Epic | Epic Egg | 85% |
| | | Legendary Egg | 14% |
| | | Mythic Egg | 1% |
| Legendary | Legendary | Legendary Egg | 90% |
| | | Mythic Egg | 10% |
| Mythic | Mythic | Mythic Egg | 100% |

**Cross-Rarity Breeding:**
- Egg rarity = weighted average of parent rarities
- Example: Rare + Epic = 50% Rare Egg, 45% Epic Egg, 5% Legendary Egg

**Strategic Depth:**
- Breed common + common for volume (fast collection filling)
- Breed rare + rare for quality (epic/legendary hunting)
- Mix rarities for balance (resource optimization)

### Hatching Odds (Variant Quality)

**The Two-Layer Gacha:**

**Layer 1 (Breeding):** Parents determine egg rarity (deterministic with RNG variance)
**Layer 2 (Hatching):** Egg rarity determines variant quality (pure gacha with pity)

**Example Flow:**
```
1. Breed: CYBER-Alpha (Rare) + CYBER-Beta (Rare)
   → 80% chance: Rare Egg, 19% chance: Epic Egg, 1% chance: Legendary Egg

2. Result: Rare Egg (RNG hit 80%)

3. Hatch Rare Egg:
   → 70% chance: Rare variant, 25% chance: Epic variant, 4.5% chance: Legendary, 0.5% chance: Mythic

4. Result: Epic variant (RNG hit 25% - lucky!)

5. Outcome: CYBER-Gamma (Epic) - Gen 2 snake added to collection
```

**Why Two Layers?**
- Layer 1 (breeding) rewards strategic parent selection
- Layer 2 (hatching) creates gacha excitement
- Pity system applies to hatching (guaranteed outcomes)
- Prevents "breed bad parents, get mythic by luck" (requires quality parents for quality eggs)

### Pity System Architecture

**Pity Counter Mechanics:**

**Rare Pity (100 Eggs):**
- Track: Total eggs hatched without Rare+ variant
- Trigger: After 100 eggs, next egg guaranteed Rare+ (70% Rare, 25% Epic, 4.5% Legendary, 0.5% Mythic)
- Reset: Counter resets to 0 after Rare+ hatch
- Display: "73 eggs since last Rare+ (pity activates at 100)"

**Legendary Pity (500 Eggs):**
- Track: Total eggs hatched without Legendary+ variant
- Trigger: After 500 eggs, next egg guaranteed Legendary+ (70% Legendary, 30% Mythic)
- Reset: Counter resets to 0 after Legendary+ hatch
- Display: "347 eggs since last Legendary (guaranteed at 500)"

**Mythic Pity (2,000 Eggs):**
- Track: Total eggs hatched without Mythic variant
- Trigger: After 2,000 eggs, next egg guaranteed Mythic (100%)
- Reset: Counter resets to 0 after Mythic hatch
- Display: "1,247 eggs since last Mythic (guaranteed at 2,000)"

**Pity Stacking:**
- All pity counters run simultaneously (independent)
- Example: Egg 500 triggers Legendary pity, Egg 501 triggers Rare pity (if applicable)
- Multiple pity triggers → higher rarity wins (Legendary pity > Rare pity)

**Transparency Requirements:**
- Pity counters visible in Breeding Lab UI (always displayed)
- Egg screen shows exact odds before hatching
- Pity trigger notification: "Pity System Active! This egg guaranteed Legendary+"
- Post-hatch: "Pity activated. Counter reset to 0."

**F2P Generosity via Pity:**
```
F2P Casual (1,200 DNA/day):
- 24 eggs/day (1,200 DNA ÷ 50 DNA per common egg pull equivalent)
- 100-egg pity: Every 4 days = 1 guaranteed Rare+
- 500-egg pity: Every 21 days = 1 guaranteed Legendary
- Annual: 365 days ÷ 21 days = 17 guaranteed Legendaries/year

F2P Hardcore (4,200 DNA/day):
- 84 eggs/day
- 100-egg pity: Every 1.2 days = 1 guaranteed Rare+
- 500-egg pity: Every 6 days = 1 guaranteed Legendary
- Annual: 365 ÷ 6 = 60 guaranteed Legendaries/year

Premium (10,000 DNA/day):
- 200 eggs/day
- 500-egg pity: Every 2.5 days = 1 guaranteed Legendary
- Annual: 365 ÷ 2.5 = 146 guaranteed Legendaries/year
```

**Result:** F2P casual gets 15-20 Legendaries/year (Supercell benchmark), hardcore gets 40-60, premium gets 100+. All fair, no exploitation.

### Mercy Timer (Time-Based Pity)

**Time Pity Mechanic:**
- If player hatches 0 Legendary+ variants in 30 consecutive days:
  - Next 10 eggs have 2× Legendary odds
  - Display: "Mercy Active: +100% Legendary chance for next 10 eggs"
  - Prevents "casual player never gets lucky" scenarios

**Why Mercy?**
- RNG can be cruel (some players unlucky for months)
- Mercy ensures even ultra-casual players get Legendaries
- Doesn't affect hardcore/premium (they hit pity before mercy)
- Psychological safety net (players know "worst case" is 30 days)

- Genshin Impact: Drop rates published, 90-pull pity (generous)
- Raid Shadow Legends: Drop rates hidden, no pity (exploitative)
- **SupaSnake: Published odds + visible pity + mercy timer = fairest gacha**

---

## 3. Genetic Trait System

### Inherited Traits from Parents

**Core Mechanic:** Children inherit stats from parents with RNG variance + mutation chance.

**Three Primary Traits:**

**1. Speed Multiplier:**
- Base: 1.0× (default snake speed in Classic Mode)
- Range: 0.8× (slow) to 1.5× (fast)
- Inheritance: Average of parents ± 10% variance
  - Example: Parent A (1.2×) + Parent B (1.4×) = Child average 1.3× ± 0.13 = 1.17×-1.43×
- Generation bonus: +0.5% per generation
  - Gen 10 snake: 1.3× base + 5% = 1.365×

**2. DNA Multiplier:**
- Base: 1.0× (default DNA earned per run)
- Range: 0.9× to 2.0×
- Inheritance: Average of parents ± 15% variance
  - Example: Parent A (1.5×) + Parent B (1.3×) = Child average 1.4× ± 0.21 = 1.19×-1.61×
- Generation bonus: +1% per generation
  - Gen 10 snake: 1.4× base + 10% = 1.54×

**3. Survival Bonus (Seconds):**
- Base: 0 seconds (no survival advantage)
- Range: -5s to +20s
- Inheritance: Average of parents ± 5s variance
  - Example: Parent A (+10s) + Parent B (+8s) = Child average +9s ± 5s = +4s to +14s
- Generation bonus: +0.2s per generation
  - Gen 10 snake: +9s base + 2s = +11s

**Trait Display:**

```
CYBER-Gamma (Epic) - Gen 2
├─ Speed: 1.23× (Fast)
├─ DNA Bonus: 1.47× (Excellent)
└─ Survival: +7s (Good)

Parents:
├─ CYBER-Alpha: Speed 1.2×, DNA 1.5×, Survival +10s
└─ CYBER-Beta: Speed 1.3×, DNA 1.3×, Survival +8s

Genetics: Inherited Speed (avg 1.25× → rolled 1.23×)
          Inherited DNA (avg 1.4× → rolled 1.47×)
          Inherited Survival (avg +9s → rolled +7s)
```

### Mutation Chance (5% Random Trait)

**Mutation Mechanics:**
- 5% chance per breeding: Child gains random bonus trait
- Mutation types:
  1. **Super Speed:** +20% speed (stacks with inherited speed)
  2. **DNA Jackpot:** +50% DNA for 1 run (triggers randomly in Classic Mode)
  3. **Invincibility Frame:** 1-second invincibility at start of each run
  4. **Combo Master:** +2 combo multiplier (combos count as 3, 6, 9 instead of 1, 2, 3)
  5. **Regen Scales:** Regenerate 1 segment every 30 seconds

**Mutation Inheritance:**
- Mutations do NOT pass to children (1-generation only)
- Encourages breeding mutants (rare, valuable for personal use)
- Prevents "mutation stacking" meta (no Gen 50 snake with 50 mutations)

**Visual Indicator:**
- Mutant snakes glow with unique aura (rainbow shimmer)
- Collection book shows mutation icon
- Rarity: 5% = ~1 mutation per 20 breeds

**Strategic Value:**
- Mutants powerful for Classic Mode (DNA farming, high scores)
- Can't breed mutants to inherit mutation (prevents pay-to-win breeding chains)
- Collectors chase mutants for prestige (5% rare = bragging rights)

### Trait Stacking (Generation Bonuses)

**Generational Stat Scaling:**

| Generation | Speed Bonus | DNA Bonus | Survival Bonus | Total Power |
|------------|-------------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Gen 1 | +0.5% | +1% | +0.2s | Baseline |
| Gen 5 | +2.5% | +5% | +1s | 8.5% stronger |
| Gen 10 | +5% | +10% | +2s | 17% stronger |
| Gen 20 | +10% | +20% | +4s | 34% stronger |
| Gen 50 | +25% | +50% | +10s | 85% stronger |
| Gen 100 | +50% | +100% | +20s | 170% stronger |

**Power Ceiling:**
- No hard cap on generation (Gen 1,000 theoretically possible)
- Exponential DNA costs ensure Gen 100+ takes years (realistic cap ~Gen 50-100 for most players)
- Gen 50 snake = 85% stronger than Gen 1 (meaningful but not game-breaking)

**Competitive Balance:**
- Classic Mode leaderboards can restrict by generation (Gen 1-10 bracket, Gen 11-25 bracket, etc.)
- Prevents Gen 100 whales stomping Gen 1 F2P players
- Skill still matters more than generation (Gen 1 expert > Gen 50 casual)

## 4. Generation System (Prestige Mechanics)

### Gen 1 → Gen ∞ (Infinite Vertical Climb)

**Core Formula:**
- 2 parents of Gen N → 1 child of Gen (N+1)
- Parents consumed permanently (sacrifice mechanic)
- DNA cost: `200 × (Generation²)`

**Generation Ladder:**

| Generation | DNA Cost (Per Breed) | Parents Required | Cumulative DNA | Time (F2P Casual) | Time (F2P Hardcore) | Time (Premium) |
|------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Gen 1 | N/A (gacha pull) | 0 | 50 DNA (pull) | 1 run | 1 run | 1 run |
| Gen 2 | 200 DNA | 2× Gen 1 | 250 DNA | 3 hours | 1 hour | 30 min |
| Gen 3 | 800 DNA | 2× Gen 2 | 1,050 DNA | 12 hours | 4 hours | 2 hours |
| Gen 5 | 6,000 DNA | 2× Gen 4 | ~10,000 DNA | 2 days | 18 hours | 8 hours |
| Gen 10 | 20,000 DNA | 2× Gen 9 | ~50,000 DNA | 1 month | 10 days | 5 days |
| Gen 20 | 80,000 DNA | 2× Gen 19 | ~500,000 DNA | 10 months | 3 months | 1.5 months |
| Gen 50 | 500,000 DNA | 2× Gen 49 | ~10M DNA | 10+ years | 3-4 years | 1-2 years |
| Gen 100 | 2,000,000 DNA | 2× Gen 99 | ~100M DNA | Impossible F2P | 5-10 years | 3-5 years |

**Exponential Scaling Rationale:**
- Gen 1-10: Accessible to all players (weeks-months)
- Gen 11-25: Dedicated players (months-year)
- Gen 26-50: Hardcore/whale territory (years)
- Gen 51-100: Aspirational, near-impossible (top 0.01%)
- Gen 100+: Theoretical ceiling, infinite progression

**Visual Progression:**

| Generation Tier | Visual Effects | Unlock |
|----------------|----------------|--------|
| Gen 1-5 | Subtle glow | Base tier |
| Gen 6-10 | Particle trail (dynasty color) | "Adept Breeder" title |
| Gen 11-20 | Animated aura + enhanced trail | "Master Breeder" title |
| Gen 21-30 | Full-screen shimmer + exclusive border | "Elite Breeder" title |
| Gen 31-50 | Legendary aura + global announcement on breed | "Legendary Bloodline" title |
| Gen 51-100 | Mythical effects + prestige icon | "Ancient Lineage" title |
| Gen 100+ | Custom animations per snake | "Eternal Bloodline" title (permanent) |

**Generation Bonuses (Per Gen):**
- **Speed:** +0.5% per gen (Gen 100 = +50% speed)
- **DNA Multiplier:** +1% per gen (Gen 100 = +100% DNA = 2× income)
- **Survival:** +0.2s per gen (Gen 100 = +20s survival head start)

**Strategic Depth:**
- Which dynasty to push to Gen 50? (Resource allocation)
- Breed multiple Gen 10s or one Gen 20? (Volume vs. prestige)
- Cross-dynasty breeding at high gens (hybrid Gen 50 snakes)

### Generation Bonuses (Stat Scaling)

**Stat Growth Formula:**

**Speed:**
- Base: 1.0× (Gen 1 snake, average traits)
- Per Gen: +0.5%
- Example: Gen 50 snake with base 1.2× speed = 1.2× × 1.25 (Gen bonus) = 1.5× speed (capped at 1.5× max)

**DNA Multiplier:**
- Base: 1.0× (Gen 1 snake)
- Per Gen: +1%
- Example: Gen 50 snake with base 1.3× DNA = 1.3× × 1.5 (Gen bonus) = 1.95× DNA

**Survival Bonus:**
- Base: 0s (Gen 1 snake)
- Per Gen: +0.2s
- Example: Gen 50 snake with base +5s survival = +5s + 10s (Gen bonus) = +15s survival

**Power Curve Implications:**

```
Gen 1 Snake (F2P Casual, Month 1):
- Speed: 1.0×, DNA: 1.0×, Survival: 0s
- Classic Mode: 30 DNA/run avg, 45s survival avg

Gen 10 Snake (F2P Casual, Month 3):
- Speed: 1.05×, DNA: 1.1×, Survival: +2s
- Classic Mode: 40 DNA/run avg, 50s survival avg

## 5. Breeding Strategy & Depth

### Min-Maxing (Optimize for Specific Stats)

**Strategy 1: Speed-Focused Breeding**

**Goal:** Maximize speed multiplier for leaderboard climbing

**Process:**
1. Pull 10 CYBER snakes from gacha (common tier, cheap)
2. Identify highest speed snakes (1.3×, 1.2×, 1.25×, etc.)
3. Breed 1.3× + 1.25× = Avg 1.275× ± 10% = 1.15×-1.4× (hope for 1.4× roll)
4. Result: Gen 2 snake with 1.4× speed (lucky roll)
5. Repeat: Breed 1.4× + 1.3× = Avg 1.35× → Gen 3 snake with 1.45× speed (max cap)
6. Push generations: Gen 10 speed-focused snake = 1.45× base + 5% = 1.52× (capped at 1.5× max)

**Use Case:**
- Leaderboard pushing (speed = longer runs = more DNA = higher rank)
- Speedrun achievements (90s+ runs)
- Competitive events (weekly tournaments)

**Strategy 2: DNA Farming Breeding**

**Goal:** Maximize DNA multiplier for collection acceleration

**Process:**
1. Breed for DNA multiplier (same logic as speed)
2. Target: 1.8×-2.0× DNA multiplier (max cap)
3. Push to Gen 10: 2.0× base + 10% = 2.2× DNA (capped at 2.0× max)
4. Result: Every Classic Mode run earns 2× DNA (40 DNA → 80 DNA)

**Use Case:**
- F2P players accelerate collection (2× DNA = complete dynasties 2× faster)
- Efficient resource farming (maximize DNA/hour)
- Dynasty completion races

**Strategy 3: Survival Tanking**

**Goal:** Maximize survival bonus for endurance runs

**Process:**
1. Breed for +survival trait (target +15s+)
2. Push to Gen 10: +15s base + 2s (Gen bonus) = +17s survival
3. Result: Every Classic Mode run starts with 17-second buffer (easier to hit 90s+)

**Use Case:**
- Achievement hunting (120s survival)
- Leaderboard endurance categories
- Casual players (easier runs, less stress)

### Lineage Purity (Breed Within Dynasty for Synergy)

**Dynasty Synergy Bonuses:**

**Pure Lineage Mechanic:**
- If both parents same dynasty → Child gets +5% dynasty bonus
- Stacks with generation bonuses
- Example: Gen 10 CYBER snake (pure lineage) = +5% DNA + 10% (Gen bonus) = 15% total bonus

**Hybrid Penalty:**
- If parents different dynasties → Child gets -5% to all stats
- Encourages specialization (pure CYBER breeding vs. CYBER+PRIMAL hybrid)
- Hybrid snakes have unique cosmetics (visual distinction)

**Strategic Trade-off:**
- Pure lineage: Stronger stats, dynasty-specific bonuses
- Hybrid: Access to cross-dynasty traits (v1.0+ feature), cosmetic uniqueness

**Synergy Examples:**

**CYBER Dynasty Pure Lineage:**
- Bonus: +5% speed (CYBER theme: fast, digital)
- Gen 10 CYBER (pure) = 1.5× speed cap + 5% synergy = 1.575× (above cap for pure lineage)

**PRIMAL Dynasty Pure Lineage:**
- Bonus: +5% survival (PRIMAL theme: endurance, ancient)
- Gen 10 PRIMAL (pure) = +2s (Gen) + 5% survival = +2.1s

**COSMIC Dynasty Pure Lineage:**
- Bonus: +5% DNA (COSMIC theme: abundance, nebulae)
- Gen 10 COSMIC (pure) = 1.1× DNA (Gen) + 5% = 1.155× DNA

### Cross-Breeding (Across Dynasties for Hybrid Traits)

**Hybrid Breeding (v1.0+ Feature):**

**Mechanic:**
- Breed CYBER + PRIMAL = Hybrid snake (50% CYBER, 50% PRIMAL traits)
- Hybrid snakes have unique cosmetics (blended aesthetics)
  - Example: CYBER+PRIMAL = Digital tribal patterns, neon runes
- Hybrid snakes lose dynasty synergy bonus (-5% stats)
- Hybrid snakes gain hybrid trait (unique ability)

**Hybrid Traits (Unlocked v1.0):**

| Hybrid Type | Trait Name | Effect |
|-------------|------------|--------|
| CYBER + PRIMAL | "Ancient Code" | +10% DNA from runs, +2s survival |
| CYBER + COSMIC | "Nebula Circuit" | +15% speed, particle trail combines both dynasties |
| PRIMAL + COSMIC | "Stellar Origins" | +5% all stats, unique cosmetic (galaxy tribal) |

**Strategic Depth:**
- Pure lineage for max stats (competitive min-maxing)
- Hybrid for cosmetic collection (unique variants)
- Hybrid for balanced stats (jack-of-all-trades snakes)

**Example Hybrid:**

```
CYBER-PRIMAL Hybrid (Gen 5):
├─ Speed: 1.1× (CYBER influence)
├─ DNA: 1.3× (COSMIC influence)
├─ Survival: +6s (PRIMAL influence)
├─ Hybrid Trait: "Ancient Code" (+10% DNA, +2s survival)
└─ Cosmetic: Digital tribal tattoos, neon runes, particle trail (blue + green mix)

Ancestry:
├─ CYBER-Alpha (Gen 4, pure CYBER)
└─ PRIMAL-Beta (Gen 4, pure PRIMAL)
```

### Competitive Meta (Which Breeding Strategies Dominate?)

**Meta Tier List (Ranked by Competitive Viability):**

**S-Tier (Optimal Strategies):**
1. **Speed-Focused Pure CYBER (Gen 10+):**
   - Why: Speed = longer runs = more DNA = leaderboard dominance
   - Target: 1.5× speed cap + 5% synergy = 1.575× speed

- Classic Mode: 30 runs/day × 20 DNA = 600 DNA
- Daily quests: +500 DNA
- Daily login: +100 DNA
- Total: 1,200 DNA/day

**Breeding Budget:**
- 1,200 DNA/day = 24 common eggs (50 DNA each) OR 2 rare eggs (600 DNA each)
- Mix: 10 common eggs (500 DNA) + 1 rare egg (600 DNA) + 100 DNA saved

**Legendary Acquisition Rate:**
- Rare eggs: 4.5% Legendary chance
- 1 rare egg/day = 365 rare eggs/year
- Expected Legendaries: 365 × 4.5% = 16.4 Legendaries/year (pity guarantees ~17-20)

**Pity Boost:**
- 500-egg pity: Guaranteed Legendary every 500 eggs
- 24 eggs/day × 365 days = 8,760 eggs/year
- 8,760 ÷ 500 = 17.5 guaranteed Legendaries from pity
- Total: 16.4 (RNG) + 17.5 (pity) = **33.9 Legendaries/year** (exceeds 15-20 target)

**Mythic Acquisition:**
- 2,000-egg pity: Guaranteed Mythic every 2,000 eggs
- 8,760 eggs/year ÷ 2,000 = 4.3 guaranteed Mythics/year
- RNG Mythics: 8,760 × 0.1% (rare egg Mythic rate) = 8.7 Mythics/year
- Total: **13 Mythics/year** (generous for F2P casual)

**Result:** F2P casual gets 34 Legendaries + 13 Mythics = **47 high-rarity variants/year** (very generous)

### F2P Hardcore (40-50 Legendary Variants/Year)

**Daily DNA Income:**
- Classic Mode: 60 runs/day × 60 DNA (skilled) = 3,600 DNA
- Daily quests: +500 DNA
- Daily login: +100 DNA
- Weekly challenges: +10,000 DNA ÷ 7 = +1,428 DNA/day
- Total: 5,628 DNA/day

**Breeding Budget:**
- 5,628 DNA/day = 112 common eggs OR 9 rare eggs OR 2 epic eggs
- Optimal mix: 5 rare eggs (3,000 DNA) + 50 common eggs (2,500 DNA) + 128 DNA saved

**Legendary Acquisition:**
- 5 rare eggs/day × 365 days = 1,825 rare eggs/year
- Expected Legendaries: 1,825 × 4.5% = 82 Legendaries/year (RNG)
- Pity Legendaries: 1,825 ÷ 500 = 3.6 guaranteed/year (minimal pity needed)
- Total: **82-85 Legendaries/year** (exceeds 40-50 target)

**Mythic Acquisition:**
- 1,825 rare eggs × 0.5% Mythic = 9.1 Mythics/year (RNG)
- Pity Mythics: (112 common + 5 rare) × 365 = 42,705 eggs/year ÷ 2,000 = 21.3 Mythics/year (pity)
- Total: **30 Mythics/year**

**Result:** F2P hardcore gets 85 Legendaries + 30 Mythics = **115 high-rarity variants/year** (extremely generous)

### Premium (100+ Legendary Variants/Year)

**Daily DNA Income:**
- F2P hardcore base: 5,628 DNA/day
- Breeder's Journal bonus: +500 DNA/day (premium track)
- VIP subscription: +1,000 DNA/day (10% bonus + daily refill)

- Optimal: 10 rare eggs (5,000 DNA) + 50 common eggs (2,500 DNA) + 461 DNA saved

**Legendary Acquisition:**
- 10 rare eggs/day × 365 = 3,650 rare eggs/year
- Expected Legendaries: 3,650 × 4.5% = 164 Legendaries/year
- Total: **164 Legendaries/year** (exceeds 100+ target)

**Mythic Acquisition:**
- 3,650 rare eggs × 0.5% = 18.2 Mythics/year (RNG)
- Pity: 60 eggs/day × 365 = 21,900 eggs/year ÷ 2,000 = 10.9 Mythics/year
- Total: **29 Mythics/year**

**Result:** Premium gets 164 Legendaries + 29 Mythics = **193 high-rarity variants/year** (2× F2P casual, 60% more than F2P hardcore)

### Time to Gen 10 (3 Months F2P Casual, 1 Month Hardcore)

**Gen 10 DNA Cost:**
- Cumulative: ~50,000 DNA (breeding chain Gen 1 → Gen 10)

**F2P Casual (1,200 DNA/day):**
- 50,000 DNA ÷ 1,200 DNA/day = 41.6 days = **1.4 months** (faster than 3-month target)

### Breeding Costs (By Egg Rarity)

**Gacha Pull Costs:**

| Egg Rarity | DNA Cost (Single) | 10-Pull Cost | Avg Eggs/Day (F2P Casual) | Avg Eggs/Day (F2P Hardcore) | Avg Eggs/Day (Premium) |
|------------|-------------------|--------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Common Egg | 50 DNA | 450 DNA (10% discount) | 33 eggs | 127 eggs | 179 eggs |
| Rare Egg | 150 DNA | 1,350 DNA | 11 eggs | 42 eggs | 59 eggs |
| Epic Egg | 500 DNA | 4,500 DNA | 3 eggs | 12 eggs | 17 eggs |
| Legendary Egg | 1,500 DNA | 13,500 DNA | 1 egg | 4 eggs | 5 eggs |

**Breeding Costs (Parent-to-Egg):**

| Parent Rarity Combo | DNA Cost | Incubation Time | Eggs/Day (F2P Casual) | Eggs/Day (Premium) |
|---------------------|----------|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Common + Common | 200 DNA | 2 hours | 8 breeds | 44 breeds |
| Rare + Rare | 2,000 DNA | 6 hours | 0.8 breeds | 4.4 breeds |
| Epic + Epic | 10,000 DNA | 12 hours | 0.16 breeds | 0.89 breeds |
| Legendary + Legendary | 50,000 DNA | 24 hours | 0.03 breeds (1 every 30 days) | 0.17 breeds (1 every 6 days) |

**Generation Breeding Costs:**

| Generation Upgrade | DNA Cost | Cumulative DNA | Time (F2P Casual) | Time (F2P Hardcore) | Time (Premium) |
|--------------------|----------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Gen 1 → Gen 2 | 200 DNA | 200 DNA | 3 hours | 1 hour | 30 min |
| Gen 2 → Gen 3 | 800 DNA | 1,000 DNA | 15 hours | 4 hours | 2.5 hours |

| Gen 50 → Gen 51 | 500,000 DNA | ~10M DNA | 16.6 years | 4.3 years | 3 years |

### Hatch Skip Costs (Time Monetization)

**Instant Hatch Pricing:**

| Egg Rarity | Incubation Time | Skip Cost (DNA) | Skip Cost ($) | Whales Use Case |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Common | 2 hours | 100 DNA | $0.50 | Never (too cheap to skip) |
| Rare | 6 hours | 300 DNA | $1.50 | Occasional (impatient moments) |
| Epic | 12 hours | 600 DNA | $3.00 | Regular (overnight skip) |
| Legendary | 24 hours | 1,200 DNA | $6.00 | Often (high-value eggs) |
| Mythic | 48 hours | 2,400 DNA | $12.00 | Always (mythic urgency) |

**Instant Hatch Alternatives (F2P Friendly):**

**Breeding Tokens (F2P Earnable):**
- Instantly completes any incubation (any rarity)
- Daily income: 1-2 tokens/day (daily quests, pod drops)
- F2P players can skip 1-2 timers/day (generous)
- Premium players get +1 token/day (VIP subscription)

**Why Breeding Tokens Matter:**
- F2P can skip Legendary 24h timers without spending DNA
- Encourages daily play (tokens are daily rewards)
- Prevents "wait 48 hours or pay $12" exploitation (F2P alternative exists)

### Re-Roll Mechanics (Reject Hatch for 50% DNA Refund)

**Re-Roll System:**

**How It Works:**
1. Hatch egg, see result (e.g., Common variant from Rare Egg)
2. Option: "Re-roll? Reject this result for 50% DNA refund"
3. If accepted:
   - Egg destroyed
   - Parents gone (already consumed)
   - Refund: 50% of breeding DNA cost
   - Example: Rare breeding (2,000 DNA) → refund 1,000 DNA
4. Player can use refund to breed again (new RNG roll)

**Limits:**
- **1 re-roll per egg** (prevents infinite re-rolling for Mythic)
- Re-roll consumes egg (can't re-roll same egg twice)
- 50% refund (not full refund, prevents risk-free gambling)

**Strategic Use:**
- Rare Egg hatches Common (bad luck) → Re-roll, try again
- Epic Egg hatches Rare (disappointing) → Re-roll
- Legendary Egg hatches Epic (acceptable) → Keep (re-roll risky)

**Economic Impact:**
- Reduces bad-luck frustration (player agency)
- Costs player 50% DNA (not exploitable)
- Whales use re-rolls liberally (DNA abundant)
- F2P use sparingly (DNA scarce, save for guaranteed breeds)

**Example Flow:**
```
1. Breed: CYBER-Alpha (Rare) + CYBER-Beta (Rare) = 2,000 DNA
2. Hatch: Rare Egg → Result: Common variant (unlucky, bottom 30% of Rare Egg odds)
3. Re-roll: Reject result, refund 1,000 DNA
4. Breed again: CYBER-Gamma (Rare) + CYBER-Delta (Rare) = 2,000 DNA (net cost: 3,000 DNA for 2 attempts)
5. Hatch: Rare Egg → Result: Epic variant (lucky!)
6. Keep: Accept result, add to collection
```

## 9. Comparison to Supercell Games

### Clash Royale Chests vs. SupaSnake Eggs

| Feature | Clash Royale Chests | SupaSnake Eggs |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Acquisition** | Win battles (4-chest cycle) | Breed snakes (player-initiated) |
| **Unlock Timers** | 3h, 8h, 12h, 24h | 2h, 6h, 12h, 24h, 48h |
| **Pity System** | Cycle-based (240 chests = 1 Legendary) | Counter-based (500 eggs = 1 Legendary) |
| **Transparency** | Published drop rates, visible cycle | Published drop rates, visible pity counters |
| **Opening Ceremony** | 5-10s animation (card reveal) | 5-15s animation (egg hatch) |
| **F2P Legendary Rate** | 15-20/year (generous) | 34/year (more generous) |
| **Premium Acceleration** | 2-3× faster (gem unlocks) | 2-3× faster (DNA packs, instant hatch) |
| **Duplicate Protection** | Wild Cards (convert duplicates) | Re-roll mechanic (50% DNA refund) |

**Key Differences:**
- **SupaSnake eggs are player-initiated** (breed when ready) vs. **Clash chests are time-gated** (win battle → wait for unlock)
- **SupaSnake pity is transparent** (visible counter) vs. **Clash cycle is hidden** (player must track manually)
- **SupaSnake F2P is more generous** (34 Legendaries/year vs. 15-20 Clash)

### Brawl Stars Boxes vs. SupaSnake Eggs

| Feature | Brawl Stars Boxes | SupaSnake Eggs |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Acquisition** | Earn tokens (3 per win) → Buy boxes | Breed snakes (DNA cost) |
| **Box Types** | Brawl Box (100 tokens), Big Box (300), Mega Box (600) | Common Egg (200 DNA), Rare (2,000), Epic (10,000) |
| **Pity System** | Increasing odds (0.5% → 2% after drought) | Guaranteed Legendary every 500 eggs |
| **Transparency** | Published odds, no visible pity counter | Published odds, visible pity counter |
| **Opening** | 3-5s reveal (items pop up) | 5-15s hatch ceremony |
| **F2P Legendary Rate** | 10-15/year (stingy) | 34/year (generous) |

**Key Differences:**
- **SupaSnake pity is guaranteed** (500 eggs = 100% Legendary) vs. **Brawl Stars pity is increasing odds** (not guaranteed)
- **SupaSnake is more transparent** (visible counter) vs. **Brawl Stars is opaque** (players don't know current pity odds)
- **SupaSnake breeding is strategic** (parent selection matters) vs. **Brawl Stars boxes are pure RNG**

### Why SupaSnake is Fairer

**Transparency:**
- ✅ Visible pity counters (always displayed)
- ✅ Published drop rates (exact %)
- ✅ Pre-hatch odds preview (informed decisions)

**Generosity:**
- ✅ 34 Legendaries/year F2P casual (vs. 15-20 Clash, 10-15 Brawl)
