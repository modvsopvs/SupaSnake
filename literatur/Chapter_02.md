In the last chapter we established that everything begins with the game designer,
and that the game designer needs certain skills. Now it is time to begin talking
about what a game designer uses those skills for. Put another way, we need to ask
"What is the game designer's goal?" At first, the answer seems obvious: a game
designer's goal is to design games.

But this is wrong.

Ultimately, a game designer does not care about games. Games are merely a
means to an end. On their own, games are just artifacts clumps of cardboard,
or bags of bits. Games are worthless unless people play them. Why is this? What
magic happens when games are played?

When people play games, they have an experience. It is this experience that the
designer cares about. Without the experience, the game is worthless.

I will warn you right now, we are about to enter territory that is very difficult
to talk about. Not because it is unfamiliar in fact, quite the opposite. It is hard
to talk about because it is too familiar. Everything we've ever seen (look at that
sunset!), done (have you ever flown a plane?), thought (why is the sky blue?), or
felt (this snow is so cold!) has been an experience. By definition, we can't experi-
ence anything that is not an experience. Experiences are so much a part of us, they
are hard to think about (even thinking about experiences is an experience). But, as
familiar as we are with experiences, they are very hard to describe. You can't see
them, touch them, or hold them you can't even really share them. No two peo-
ple can have identical experiences of the same thing
each person's experience of
something is completely unique.

And this is the paradox of experiences. On one level, they are shadowy and nebu-
lous, and on another, they are all we know. But as tricky as experiences can be, creat-
ing them is all a game designer really cares about. We cannot shy away from them,
retreating into the concreteness of our material game. We must use every means we
can muster to comprehend, understand, and master the nature of human experience.

## The Game Is Not the Experience

We must be absolutely clear on this point before we can proceed. The game is not
the experience. The game enables the experience, but it is not the experience. This
is a hard concept for some people to grasp. The ancient Zen question addresses this

directly: "If a tree falls in the forest, and no one is there to hear it, does it make a
sound?" This has been repeated so often that it sounds hackneyed, but it is exactly
what we are talking about. If our definition of "sound" is air molecules vibrating,
then yes, the tree makes a sound. If our definition of sound is the experience of
hearing a sound, then the answer is no, the tree makes no sound when no one is
there. As designers, we don't really care about the tree and how it falls we care
only about the experience of hearing it. The tree is just a means to an end. And if
no one is there to hear it, well, we don't care at all.

Game designers only care about what seems to exist. The player and the game
are real. The experience is imaginary - but game designers are judged by the qual-
ity of this imaginary thing because it is the reason people play games.

If we could, through some high-tech magic, create experiences for people directly,
with no underlying media no game boards, no computers, no screens we
would do it. In a sense, this is the dream of "artificial reality" to be able to create
experiences that are in no way limited by the constraints of the medium that delivers
the experiences. It is a beautiful dream, but only a dream. We cannot create expe-
riences directly. Perhaps in the distant future, using technologies hard to imagine,
such a thing could happen. Time will tell. For now, we live in the present, where all
we can do is create artifacts (rule sets, game boards, computer programs) that are
likely to create certain kinds of experiences when a player interacts with them.

And it is this that makes game design so very hard. Like building a ship in a bot-
tle, we are far removed from what we are actually trying to create. We create an arti-
fact that a player interacts with, and cross our fingers that the experience that takes
place during that interaction is something they will enjoy. We never truly see the
output of our work, since it is an experience had by someone else and, ultimately,
unsharable.

This is why deep listening is so essential for a game design.

## Is This Unique to Games?

You might well ask what is so special about games, compared to other types of
experiences, that requires us to get into all of this touchy-feely experience stuff. And
really, on one level, there is nothing special about games in this regard. Designers of
all types of entertainment books, movies, plays, music, rides, everything have
to cope with the same issue: How can you create something that will generate a cer-
tain experience when a person interacts with it?

But the split between artifact and experience is much more obvious for game
design than it is for other types of entertainment, for a not-so-obvious reason. Game
designers have to cope with much more interaction than the designers of more lin-
ear experiences. The author of a book or screenplay is designing a linear experience.
There is a fairly direct mapping between what they create and what the reader or
viewer experiences. Game designers don't have it so easy. We give the player
a great deal of control over the pacing and sequence of events in the experience.

We even throw in random events! This makes the distinction between artifact and
experience much more obvious than it is for linear entertainment. At the same time,
though, it makes it much harder to be certain just what experience is really going to
arise in the mind of the player.

So, why do we do it? What is so special about game experiences that we would
give up the luxuries of control that linear entertainers enjoy? Are we simply maso-
chists? Do we just do it for the challenge? No. As with everything else game design-
ers do, we do it for the experience it creates. There are certain feelings: feelings of
choice, feelings of freedom, feelings of responsibility, feelings of accomplishment,
feelings of friendship, and many others, which only game-based experiences seem
to offer. This is why we go through all the trouble
to generate experiences that
can be had no other way.

## Three Practical Approaches to Chasing Rainbows

>
> Thomas Edison

So
we've established what we need to do create games that will somehow
generate wonderful, compelling, memorable experiences. To do this, we must
embark on a daunting endeavor: to uncover both the mysteries of the human mind
and the secrets of the human heart. No one field of study has managed to per-
fectly map this territory (Mendeleev, where are you?), but several different fields
have managed to map out parts of it. Three, in particular, stand out: Psychology,
Anthropology, and Design. Psychologists want to understand the mechanisms that
make people tick, anthropologists want to understand people on a human level, and
designers just want to make people happy. We will be using approaches borrowed
from all three of these fields, so let's consider what each one has to offer us.

### Psychology

Who better for us to learn the nature of human experience from than psychologists,
the scientists who study the mechanisms that govern the human mind? And truly, they
have made some discoveries about the mind that are incredibly useful, some of which
will be covered in this book. In fact, you might expect that our quest for understand-
ing how to create great human experiences might end right here; that the psychologists
should have all the answers. Sadly, this is not the case. Because they are scientists,
they are forced to work in the realm of what is real and provable. Early in the twentieth
century, a schism in psychology developed. On one side of the battle were the behav-
iorists who focused only on measurable behavior, taking a "black box" approach to the
study of the mind. Their primary tool was objective, controlled experimentation. On
the other side were the phenomenologists who study what game designers care about

most
the nature of human experience and "the feeling of what happens." Their pri-
mary tool was introspection the act of examining your experiences as they happen.
Unfortunately for us, the behaviorists won out, and for very good reasons. The
behavioristic focus on objective, repeatable experiments makes for very good sci-
ence. One behaviorist can do an experiment, publish a paper about it, and other
behaviorists can repeat the experiment under the same conditions, almost certainly
getting the same results. The phenomenological approach, on the other hand, is
necessarily subjective. Experiences themselves cannot be directly measured - only
described, and described imperfectly. When an experiment takes place in your
mind, how can you possibly be sure the experimental conditions are controlled? As
fascinating and useful as it might be to study our own internal thoughts and feel-
ings, it makes for shaky science. As a result, for as much progress that has been
made by modern psychology, it generally feels obligated to avoid the thing we care
about the most the nature of human experience.

Though psychology does not have all the answers we need, it does provide some
very useful ones, as we'll see. More than that, it provides approaches we can use
quite effectively. Not bound by the strict responsibilities of good science, game
designers can make use of both behavioristic experiments and phenomenological
introspection to learn what we need to know, since ultimately, as designers, we are
not concerned with what is definitely true in the world of objective reality, but only
with what seems to be true in the world of subjective experience.

But perhaps there is another scientific approach that lies somewhere between the
two extremes of behaviorism and phenomenology?

### Anthropology

> Anthropology is the most humanistic of the sciences and the most scientific of
> the humanities.
>
> Alfred L. Kroeber

Anthropology is another major branch of study about human beings and what they
think and do. It takes a much more holistic approach than psychology, looking at
everything about people including their physical, mental, and cultural aspects. It is
very concerned with studying the similarities and differences between the various
peoples of the world, not just today, but throughout history.

Of particular interest to game designers is the approach of cultural anthropology,
which is the study of living peoples' ways of life, mostly through fieldwork. Cultural
anthropologists live with their subjects of study, and try to immerse themselves
completely in the world of the people they are trying to learn about. They strive for
objective observation of culture and practices, but at the same time they engage in
introspection and take great pains to put themselves in the place of their subjects.
This helps the anthropologist better imagine what it "feels like" to be their subjects.

We can learn a number of important things about human nature from the work
of anthropologists but much more important, by taking a cultural anthropolo-
gist's approach to our players, interviewing them, learning everything we can about
them, and putting ourselves in their place, we can gain insights that would not have
been possible from a more objective point of view.

### Design

The third field that has made important study of human experience is, not surpris-
ingly, the field of design. We will be able to learn useful things from almost every
kind of designer: musicians, architects, authors, filmmakers, industrial designers,
Web designers, choreographers, visual designers, and many more. The incredible
variety of design "rules of thumb" that comes from these different disciplines do an
excellent job of illustrating useful principles about human experience. But unfortu-
nately, these principles can often be hard for us to use. Unlike scientists, designers
seldom publish papers about their discoveries. The very best designers in various
fields often know little about the workings of other fields of design. The musi-
cian may know a lot about rhythm, but probably has given little thought to how
the principles of rhythm might apply to something non-musical, such as a novel
or stage play, even though they may have meaningful practical application there,
since they are ultimately rooted in the same place the human mind. So, to use
principles from other areas of design, we will need to cast a wide net. Anyone who
creates something that people are meant to experience and enjoy has something
to teach us, and so we will pull rules and examples from designers of every stripe,
being as "xenophilic" as possible.

Ideally, we would find ways to connect all the varied principles of design to each
other through the common ground of psychology and anthropology, since ultimately
all design principles are rooted in these. In some small ways, we will do that in this
book. Perhaps one day these three fields will find a way to unify all their principles.
For now, we will need to be content with building a few bridges here and there
this is no small accomplishment, since these are three fields that seldom have much cross-
pollination. Further, some of the bridges will prove to be surprisingly useful! The task
before us, game design, is so difficult that we cannot afford to be snobbish about
where we get our knowledge. None of these approaches can solve all our problems, so
we will mix and match them, trying to use them appropriately, like we might use tools
from a toolbox. We must be both open-minded and practical - good ideas can come
from anywhere, but they are only good for us if they help us create better experiences.

## Introspection: Powers, Perils, and Practice

We have discussed some of the places to find useful tools for mastering human
experience. Let's now focus on one tool that has been used by all three disciplines:
introspection. This is the seemingly simple act of examining your own thoughts and

feelings - that is, your own experiences. While it is true you can never truly know
the experience of another, you certainly can know your own. In one sense, it is all
you can know. By deeply listening to your own self, that is, observing, evaluating,
and describing your own experiences, you can make rapid, decisive judgments about
what is and is not working in your game, and why it is or is not working.

"But wait," you might say. "Is introspection really such a good idea? If it isn't
good enough for the scientists, why is it good enough for us?" And this is a fair
question. There are two main perils associated with using introspection:

### Peril #1: Introspection Can Lead to False Conclusions About Reality

This is the scientists' main reason to reject introspection as a valid method of
inquiry. Many pseudo-scientists over the years have come up with crackpot theories
based mainly on introspection. This happens so often because what seems to be true
in our personal experience is not necessarily really true. Socrates, for example, noted
that when we learn something new, it often feels like we knew it all along, and that
in learning it, it feels as if we were just reminded of something we already knew, but
had forgotten. This is an interesting observation, and most people can remember a
learning experience that felt this way. But Socrates then goes too far and forms an
elaborate argument that since learning can feel like recollection, we must then be
reincarnated souls who are just now remembering what we learned in past lives.

This is the problem with drawing conclusions about reality based on introspec-
tion just because something feels true, it doesn't mean it is true. People very
easily fall into the trap of building up structures of questionable logic to back up
something that feels like it must be true. Scientists learn to be disciplined about
avoiding this trap. Introspection certainly has its place in science it allows
one to examine a problem from points of view that mere logic won't allow. Good
scientists use introspection all the time
but they don't draw scientific conclusions
from it.

Fortunately for us, game design is not science! While "objective truth about real-
ity" is interesting and sometimes useful to us, we primarily care about what "feels
like it is true." Aristotle gives us another classical example that illustrates this per-
fectly. He wrote a number of works on a variety of topics, such as Logic, Physics,
Natural History, and Philosophy. He is famous for the depth of his personal intro-
spection, and when we examine his works, we find something interesting. His ideas
about physics and natural history are largely discredited today. Why? Because he
relied too much on what felt true, and not enough on controlled experiments. His
introspection led him to all kinds of conclusions we now know to be false, such as:

* Heavier objects fall faster than light ones
* The seat of consciousness is in the heart
* Life arises by spontaneous generation

And many others. So why do we remember him as a genius, and not as a crack-
pot? Because his other works, about metaphysics, drama, ethics, and the mind, are
still useful today. In these areas where what feels true matters more than what is
objectively, provably true, most of his conclusions, reached through deep introspec-
tion, stand up to scrutiny thousands of years later.

The lesson here is simple: When dealing with the human heart and mind, and
trying to understand experience and what things feel like, introspection is an incred-
ibly powerful, and trustworthy tool. As game designers, we don't need to worry
much about this first peril. We care more about how things feel and less about
what is really true. Because of this, we can often confidently trust our feelings and
instincts when making conclusions about the quality of an experience.

### Peril #2: What Is True of My Experiences May Not be True for Others

This second danger of introspection is the one we must take seriously. With the first
peril, we got a "Get Out of Jail Free Card" because we are designers, not scientists.
But we can't get away from this one so easily. This peril is the peril of subjectivity,
and a place where many designers fall into a trap: "I like playing this game, there-
fore it must be good." And sometimes, this is right. But other times, if the audi-
ence has tastes that differ from your own, it is very, very wrong. Some designers
take extreme positions on this ranging from "I will only design for people like me,
because it is the only way I can be sure my game is good" to "introspection and
subjective opinions can't be trusted. Only playtesting can be trusted." Each of these
is a "safe" position, but also has its limits and problems:

"I only design for people like me" has these problems:

* Game designers tend to have unusual tastes. There may not be enough people
    like you out there to make your game a worthwhile investment.
* You won't be designing or developing alone. If different team members have dif-
    ferent ideas about what is best, they can be hard to resolve.
* There are many kinds of games and audiences that will be completely off-limits
    to you.

"Personal opinions can't be trusted" has these problems:

* You can't leave every decision to playtesting, especially early in the process,
    when there is no game yet to playtest. At this point someone has to exert a per-
    sonal opinion about what is good and bad.
* Before a game is completely finished, playtesters may reject an unusual idea.
    They sometimes need to see it completed before they can really appreciate it. If
    you don't trust your own feelings about what is good and bad, you may, at the

advice of your playtesters, throw out an "ugly duckling" that could have grown
up to be a beautiful swan.

* Playtesting can only happen occasionally. Important game design decisions must
    be made on a daily basis.

The way out of this peril, without resorting to such limiting extremes, is again,
to listen. Introspection for game design is a process of not just listening to yourself,
but also of listening to others. By observing your own experiences, and then observ-
ing others, and trying to put yourself in their place, you start to develop a picture of
how your experiences differ from theirs. Once you have a clear picture of these dif-
ferences, you can, like a cultural anthropologist, start to put yourself in the place of
your audience and make predictions about what experiences they will and will not
enjoy. It is a delicate art that must be practiced
and with practice your skill at it
will improve.

## Dissect Your Feelings

It is not such a simple thing to know your feelings. It is not enough for a designer to
simply have a general sense about whether they like something or not. You must be
able to clearly state what you like, what you don't like, and why. A friend of mine
in college was notoriously bad at this. We would frequently drive each other crazy
with conversations like:

Me: What did you eat at the cafeteria today?

Him: Pizza. It was bad.

Me: Bad? What was bad about it?

Him: It was just ... bad.

Me: Do you mean it was too cold? Too hard? Too soggy? Too bitter? Too much
sauce? Not enough sauce? Too cheesy? What was bad about it?

Him: I don't know it was just bad!

He was simply unable to clearly dissect his experiences. In the case of the
pizza, he knew he didn't like it, but was unable to (or didn't bother to) analyze
the experience to the point where he could make useful suggestions about how
the pizza might improve. This kind of experience dissection is a main goal of your
introspection - it is something designers must do. When you play a game, you must
be able to analyze how it made you feel, what it made you think of, and what it
made you do. You must be able to state this analysis clearly. You must put words to
it, for feelings are abstract, but words are concrete, and you will need this concrete-
ness to describe to others the experiences you want your game to produce. You need
to do this kind of analysis not only when designing and playing your own games,
but also when playing games other people have created. In fact, you should be
able to analyze any experience you might have. The more you analyze your own

experiences, the more clearly you will be able to think about the kinds of experi-
ences your games should create.

## Defeating Heisenberg

But there is still a greater challenge of introspection. How can we observe our own
experiences without tainting them, since the act of observation itself is an experi-
ence? We face this problem quite often. Try to observe what your fingers are doing
as you type at a computer keyboard and you will quickly find yourself typing slowly
and making many errors, if you can still type at all. Try to observe yourself enjoying a
movie or a game, and the enjoyment can quickly fade away. Some call this "paralysis
by analysis," and others refer to it as the Heisenberg principle. This principle, in refer-
ence to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle from quantum mechanics, points out
that the motion of a particle cannot be observed without disturbing the motion of that
particle. Similarly, the nature of an experience cannot be observed without disturbing
the nature of that experience. This makes introspection sound hopeless. While it is a
challenging problem, there are ways around it that are quite effective, though some
take practice. Most of us are not in the habit of openly discussing the nature of our
thought processes, so some of the following is going to sound a little strange.

### Analyze Memories

One good thing about experiences is that we remember them. Analyzing an expe-
rience while it is happening can be hard, because the part of your mind used to
analyze is normally focused on the experience itself. Analyzing your memory of an
experience is much easier. Memory is imperfect, but analyzing a memory is better
than nothing. Of course, the more you remember, the better, so working either with
memories of powerful experiences (these often make the best inspiration, anyway)
or with fresh memories is best. If you have the mental discipline, it also can be very
useful to engage in an experience (such as playing a game), with the intention of
not analyzing it while you play, but with the intention of analyzing the memory of
it immediately after. Just having this intention can help you remember more details
of the experience without interfering with the experience itself. This does require
you to remember that you are going to analyze it without letting that thought inter-
fere with the experience. Tricky!

### Two Passes

A method that builds on analyzing memories is to run through your experience
twice. The first time, don't stop to analyze anything just have the experience.
Then, go back and do it again, this time, analyzing everything - maybe even paus-
ing to take notes. You have the untainted experience fresh in your mind, and the

second run through lets you "relive it," but gives you a chance to stop and think,
considering how it felt, and why.

### Sneak Glances

Is it possible to observe your experience without spoiling it? It is, but it takes some
practice. It sounds strange to say this, but if you "sneak quick glances" at your expe-
rience while it is happening, you can often observe it quite well without degrading
or interrupting it significantly. It is kind of like trying to get a good look at a stranger
in a public place. Take a few short glances at them, and they won't notice you are
observing them. But look too long, and you will catch their attention, and they will
notice you staring. Fortunately, you can learn a lot about an experience with a few
short "mental glances." Again, this takes some mental discipline or you will get car-
ried away with analysis. If you can make these mental glances habitual, just doing
them all the time without thinking about it, they will interrupt things even less.
Most people find what really interrupts their train of thought, or train of experience,
is interior mental dialog. When you start asking and answering too many questions
in your head, your experience is doomed. A "quick glance" is more like: "Exciting
enough? Yes." Then, you immediately stop analyzing and get back to the experi-
ence, until the next glance.

### Observe Silently

Ideally, though, you want to observe what is happening to you while it is happen-
ing, not just through a few quick glances, but through continuous observation. You
want it to be as if you were sitting outside yourself, watching yourself, except that
you see more than a normal observer. You can hear all of your thoughts and feel all
of your feelings. When you enter this state, it is almost as if you have two minds:
one moving, engaged in an experience, and one still, silently observing the other.
This may sound completely bizarre, but it is quite possible and quite useful. It is a
difficult state to achieve, but it can be reached. It seems to be something like the Zen
practice of self-observation, and it is not unlike the meditation exercise of trying to
observe your own breathing cycle. Normally we breathe without thinking, but at any
moment, we may consciously take control of our breathing process consequently
interfering with it. With practice however, you can observe your natural, uncon-
scious breathing without disturbing it. But this takes practice, just as observing your
experiences takes practice. Observing your experiences can be practiced anywhere
while watching TV, while working, while playing, or while doing anything at all.
You won't get it right at first, but if you keep experimenting and practicing, you will
start to get the hang of it. It will take a great deal of practice. But if you truly want to
listen to your self, and understand the nature of human experience, you will find the
practice worthwhile.

## Essential Experience

But how does all this talk about experience and observations really fit in with games?
If I want to make a game about, say, a snowball fight, does analyzing my memories
of a real snowball fight have any bearing on the snowball fight game I want to make?
There is no way I can perfectly replicate the experience of a real snowball fight with-
out real snow and real friends outside in the real world so what is the point?

The point is that you don't need to perfectly replicate real experiences to make a
good game. What you need to do is to capture the essence of those experiences for
your game. What does "the essence of an experience" really mean? Every memo-
rable experience has some key features that define it and make it special. When
you go over your memory of a snowball fight experience, for example, you might
think of a lot of things. Some you might even consider essential to that experi-
ence: "There was so much snow, school was canceled," "We played right in the
street," "The snow was just right for packing," "It was so cold, but sunny the
sky was so blue," "There were kids everywhere," "We built this huge fort," "Fred
threw a snowball really high when I looked up at it, he chucked one right at my
head!," "We couldn't stop laughing." There are also parts of that experience that
you don't consider essential: "I was wearing corduroy pants," "I had some mints in
my pocket," "A man walking his dog looked at us."

As a game designer trying to design an experience, your goal is to figure out the
essential elements that really define the experience you want to create, and find
ways to make them part of your game design. This way the players of your game
get to experience those essential elements. Much of this book will be about the
many ways you can craft a game to get across the experience you want players to
have. The key idea here is that the essential experience can often be delivered in a
form that is very different from a real experience. To follow up on the snowball fight
example, what are some of the ways you could convey the experience "it was so
cold" through a snowball fight game? If it is a videogame, you could certainly use
artwork: the characters could breathe little puffs of condensation, and they could
have a shivering animation. You could use sound effects perhaps a whistling
wind could convey coldness. Maybe there wasn't a cold wind on the day you are
imagining, but the sound effect might capture the essence and deliver an experience
that seems cold to the player. You could use the rules of the game, too, if cold was
really important to you. Maybe players can make better snowballs without gloves,
but when their hands get too cold, they have to put gloves on. Again, that might
not have really happened, but that game rule helps deliver an experience of cold-
ness that will be integral part of your game.

Some people find this approach strange
they say, "Just design a game, and
see what experience comes out of it!" And I suppose it is true if you don't know
what you want, you might not care what you get. But if you do know what you
want - if you have a vision of how you would like your game to feel to the players
you need to consider how you are going to deliver the essential experience. And this
brings us to our first lens.

### Lens #1: The Lens of Essential Experience

To use this lens, you stop thinking about your game and start thinking about
the experience of the player. Ask yourself these questions:

* What experience do I want the player to have?
* What is essential to that experience?
* How can my game capture that essence?

If there is a big difference between the experience you want to create and the
one you are actually creating, your game needs to change: You need to clearly
state the essential experience you desire, and find as many ways as possible to
instill this essence into your game.

The design of the very successive baseball game in Wii Sports is an excellent
example of the Lens of Essential Experience in use. Originally, the designers had
intended to make it as much like real baseball as possible with the added bonus
that you could swing your controller like a bat. As they proceeded, though, they
realized they wouldn't have time to simulate every aspect of baseball as well as they
wanted. So, they made a big decision since swinging the controller was the most
unique part of this game, they would focus all their attention on getting that part of
the baseball experience right what they felt was the essential part. They decided
that other details (nine innings, stealing bases, etc.) were not part of the essential
experience they were trying to create.

It is true that many designers do not use the Lens of Essential Experience. They
just kind of follow their gut instinct, and stumble across game structures that hap-
pen to enable experiences that people enjoy. The danger with this approach is that
it relies on luck to a large extent. To be able to separate the experience from the
game is very useful: If you have a clear picture in your mind of the experiences
your players are having, and what parts of your game enable that experience, you
will have a much clearer picture of how to make your game better, because you will
know which elements of the game you can safely change, and which ones you can-
not. The ultimate goal of the game designer is to deliver an experience. When you
have a clear picture of your ideal experience, and its essential elements, your design
has something to aspire to. Without that goal you are just wandering in the dark.

## All That's Real Is What You Feel

All this talk of experience brings out an idea that is very strange indeed. The only
reality that we can know is the reality of the experience. And we know that what we

experience is "not really reality." We filter reality through our senses, and through
our minds, and the consciousness we actually experience is a kind of illusion
not
really reality at all. But this illusion is all that can ever be real for us, because it is
us. This is a headache for philosophers, but a wonderful thing for game designers,
because it means that the designed experiences that are created through our games
have a chance of feeling as real and as meaningful (and sometimes more so) than
