<p class="noindent">It is time to face another painful truth.</p>
<p class="indent">I know that you, personally, are designing games out of love for the medium. If there were no way to make money at game design, you would surely continue to do it as a hobby. The very word &#8220;amateur&#8221; literally means lover.</p>
<p class="indent">But money is the fuel that drives the game industry.</p>
<p class="indent">If games were not profitable, the industry would wither and die.</p>
<p class="indent">And in the real world of the game industry, there are many people who, if they learned today they could make 2% more profit a year selling can openers instead of games, would do so and feel really proud of their choice.</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps you view these people with a certain contempt. But should you? Profits are necessary to the industry&#8212;who better to be in charge of them than people who love money? I mean, you don&#8217;t want to worry about money all day, do you? You have games to design. Why not let the money people be in charge of the money and the design people be in charge of the design, and everyone will be happy, right?</p>
<p class="indent">Sadly, no. Remember &#8220;form follows funding?&#8221; Decisions that the money people make (&#8220;you need to make this game with $200K, not the $450K you asked for&#8221;; &#8220;we&#8217;ve decided this game needs to have microtransactions, not a subscription&#8221;; &#8220;you have to include in-game advertising&#8221;) can have a tremendous impact on the game design. And the opposite is true&#8212;game design decisions will have an enormous impact on profitability. In a weird way, design and management each hold the strings controlling the destiny of the other. Because of this, the money people are going to step in and tell you how to design your game, because they are afraid you might not understand the impacts of your design on profitability. And when there is a conflict between the two of you, who do you think is going to win? Keep in mind the golden rule: the one with the gold makes the rules.</p>
<p class="indent">For this reason, it&#8217;s really important that you understand enough about the business of games so that you can have an intelligent discussion with the money people. This will give you much more creative control, because if you can explain why your precious feature will make more money, in terms they&#8217;ll understand and believe, you&#8217;ve got a much better shot at having the game turn out the way you know is best.</p>
<p class="indent">You might be thinking, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know the first thing about business&#8212;all this financial stuff is going to be over my head.&#8221; But as a game designer, you already know a lot about psychology, and every business decision is really just a bet on the nature of human psychology. You don&#8217;t have to master every financial detail&#8212;you just need to know enough about the game business to think about it and talk about it. It&#8217;s certainly simpler than learning about probability, and you seemed to understand that pretty well. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve met someone with an MBA who, surprisingly, didn&#8217;t seem too bright. If that guy can understand it, so can you. And making money is a lot like a game&#8212;when you consider it from that point of view, it can actually be kind of fun to think about.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="p537" aria-label=" page 537. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>This chapter isn&#8217;t going to get into great detail about the business of games&#8212;there are other books for that. But we&#8217;ll talk about things you can do to make it easier to have meaningful conversations with the people who hold the purse strings on your game.</p>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec32_2_1"><span class="pd_orange">Retail</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">To understand any business, follow the money. If you understand where the money goes and why, you understand the business. For example, when a consumer buys a $50 retail game title, this diagram shows, on average, where the money ends up:</p>
<figure class="figure" id="fig32_2">
<figcaption>
<p class="title"><span class="pd_orange"><small>FIGURE</small><br/><b>32.2</b></span></p>
<img alt="" src="../images/fig32_2.jpg"/>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="noindentb">Seeing this kind of diagram leads to questions like the following:</p>
<section class="dialog">
<p class="que">Q: What is a platform holder?</p>
<p class="ans">A: This is the company that makes a given console (Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft). They don&#8217;t usually make any money selling the consoles (they often lose money, selling them below cost!). They make their money by &#8220;taxing&#8221; the publisher for each title made.</p>
</section>
<section class="dialog">
<p class="speech3"><span id="p538" aria-label=" page 538. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Q: Why does the retailer take so much?</p>
<p class="speech3">A: Doesn&#8217;t the retailer seem greedy? But they aren&#8217;t. Retail is a low-margin business where they have to cut every possible corner to survive. It just costs a lot to run a store.</p>
<p class="speech3">Q: Why does the publisher take so much?</p>
<p class="speech3">A: Look at everything they have to do! They have to coordinate and bargain with all these different companies, and if anything goes wrong, they are the ones who lose money. If the game doesn&#8217;t sell, the developer still got paid to make the title, and the retailer will make the publisher buy back the unsold titles. Part of the reason the publisher takes so much is because they have to pay for titles that lose money.</p>
<p class="speech3">Q: What is a markdown reserve?</p>
<p class="speech3">A: Eventually, the title will be marked down, sold at a lower price. The retailer makes the publisher absorb some of the loss when this happens. On average, that comes to about $3 a unit.</p>
</section>
<p class="noindent">Now, keep in mind, these numbers are averages. What really happens is much more detailed and can vary from one situation to another. But still! Look how much of the player&#8217;s $50 go to things that have nothing to do with actually making the game! You can see why developers were so excited when it became possible to sell directly to the consumer. Surely, it will be a win/win, right? The consumer pays less, and the developer gets more! Well, let&#8217;s take a look.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec32_2_2"><span class="pd_orange">Direct Download</span></h3>
<figure class="figure" id="fig32_3">

<img alt="" src="../images/fig32_3.jpg"/>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="noindent">There we go, that&#8217;s more like it! This simple model cuts out the publisher, and the retailer, the platform holder, and even the disk manufacturer. This is the model <span id="p539" aria-label=" page 539. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>(more or less) that Steam and the Apple app store use. Clean and simple! The consumer pays a low price, say, $10, and the developer generally collects 70% of that. But, hey&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="speech3">Q: What&#8217;s that question mark next to the $7?</p>
<p class="speech3">A: Well, that&#8217;s because this diagram assumes the developer spends zero on marketing and advertising. Which is sometimes the case, but not usually. Usually, some amount of money needs to be spent to get people to find out about the game. This used to be the publisher&#8217;s problem, but if you are self-publishing, well, it&#8217;s your problem now. Look back to <a class="figure" href="C35_chapter32.xhtml#fig32_2">Figure 32.2</a>, where the publisher was spending $6 per customer, on average; if you do that here, you only are left with $1! Trying to decide how much to spend to acquire customers is one of the most challenging aspects of self-publishing, because there are no guarantees, and you must be careful not to spend more than the game takes in.</p>

</figure>
<p class="noindent">Shortly after direct download games appeared, prices started to drop, for reasons we&#8217;ll get into later. Eventually, they dropped all the way to zero, as developers realized that the way to get the most players was to give the game away for free, wait till players needed something, and then charge them for it. On one level, this seems great for players (they get to try the game for free to see if they like it), but on the other hand, players often feel like the game designer is intentionally designing game situations that lure the player into wanting to pay at key moments. Players feel this way because it&#8217;s true! Love it or hate it, that&#8217;s the way free-to-play (F2P) works. <span id="p540" aria-label=" page 540. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>And it does work, to the tune of millions and millions of dollars. So let&#8217;s check out the diagram.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="speech3">Q: What is average LTV?</p>
<p class="speech3">A: LTV stands for lifetime value. That is, how much the average player pays over their entire play history. With F2P games, lots of players will pay zero. But some will pay a lot. The average amount spent per player is the average LTV. LTV varies widely from game to game, so don&#8217;t take this $5 amount very seriously.</p>
<p class="speech3">Q: What is customer acquisition?</p>
<p class="speech3">A: That&#8217;s the way we measure what it costs, on average, to get someone to play your game. Again, $3 is just an example. With a very viral game, it might cost less. With some games, it costs more.</p>
<p class="speech3">Q: Fifty cents profit? Aren&#8217;t I going to need a lot of customers?</p>
<p class="speech3">A: Yes&#8230; yes you are. If your game cost $500K to make (a typical budget for a modest mobile game), you&#8217;ll need a million players at these costs just to break even. You can see why increasing the LTV and decreasing the customer acquisition costs are so very important.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">I&#8217;m sure you have many more questions about this&#8212;following the money does that&#8212;it raises questions&#8212;find the answers, and you&#8217;ll understand the business model. There are other business models, of course&#8212;subscriptions, board and card games, advergames, games that give you extra powers when you buy toys, and many more. And the peculiarities of each business model exert powerful forces that help define the nature of the games sold through them, which is why you need to understand them. It isn&#8217;t hard, really. If you find yourself baffled by a new business model, all you have to do is find a money person and ask them &#8220;Hey, can you show me where the money goes?&#8221; and pretty soon you&#8217;ll know just what questions to ask.</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec32_3"><span class="pd_orange">Know Your Competition</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">When you send your game out into the world, it doesn&#8217;t really go straight to consumers. First, it must battle with dozens of other games to win the hearts and minds of potential players. It helps a great deal if you know something about what your game is competing with, for that can be as important as how good it is. Is your game the only zombie-pet-farming sim out there, or are there dozens? How does your game look compared to the others? Are you the best-in-breed or the low-budget alternative? Hopefully, your game is filling a gap that you have perceived in the market&#8212;something that people will really want, that isn&#8217;t already out there. If you can show the money people that you have done a thorough &#8220;gap analysis&#8221; by looking at games that are close to yours but that are missing a key component that you will provide, it will help your case immensely.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3">
<h2 class="h3" id="sec32_4"><span id="p541" aria-label=" page 541. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="pd_orange">Know Your Audience</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Way back in <a class="nounder" href="C12_chapter9.xhtml#chapter9">Chapter 9</a>: <a class="nounder" href="C12_chapter9.xhtml#chapter9"><i>Player</i></a>, we talked about the importance of knowing your audience so you can make them a great game. But you need to understand not just how your audience plays, but how your audience pays. What price point is going to seem fair to them? How do they feel about free to play? Is a high-priced game a turnoff for them, or do they see that as a valuable game? What features make them decide to buy a game? Your answers to these questions may shape your game more than anything else, so you need have solid answers. Use your designer powers here to see what the money people can&#8217;t. Sometimes, all they can see are charts and tables. If you can see into the heart and mind of your player and come up with a new pricing model you are sure they will find fair, you will be able to have more impact on the profitability of a game than a hundred financial analysts.</p>
<p class="indent">Consider the game <i>Dungeons &#38; Dragons Online</i>. The designers originally made a subscription game, but as that model started to weaken, they decided to switch it to F2P. Many players dislike F2P adventure games&#8212;it can feel like you are cheating. It is as if the game says, &#8220;Hey&#8230; can&#8217;t kill the dragon, huh? Well, pay me $5 for this magic battle axe, and I bet you can do it.&#8221; So, you sheepishly pay the money, get the magic battle axe, kill the dragon, and, well, feel kind of like a failure. But consider how the designers of <i>Dungeons &#38; Dragons Online</i> did it: they don&#8217;t ask you to pay for weapons; they ask you to pay for adventures. Their game feels-different, as if it says, &#8220;Would you like to go into the Dragon&#8217;s Cave? That adventure costs $5.&#8221; So, you pay for it and, with many tries and much difficulty, eventually slay the dragon. And on his treasure heap, guess what? There&#8217;s a magic battle axe. In both games, you paid $5 and ended up with a magic weapon, but in one, you feel like a cheat, and in the other, you feel like a hero. And all because someone understood the psychology of their player.</p>
<p class="indent">One significant consideration is whether you are making a &#8220;hardcore&#8221; or &#8220;casual&#8221; game. Honestly, it can be hard to draw a distinction between these categories, sometimes, as some people play <i>Dark Souls</i> casually, just for an hour once in a while, and others play eighty hours of hardcore <i>Farmville</i> a week. But what we mean when we use these terms is whether a player self-identifies as a &#8220;gamer.&#8221; If they do, they are often willing to pay a high price for content that means a lot to them. If they don&#8217;t self-identify this way, it doesn&#8217;t mean they never play games&#8212;they might play <i>Angry Birds</i> or <i>Subway Surfer</i> several times a week, but only to kill time. So, what&#8217;s the difference that matters most? How much they are willing to pay. There are probably a hundred casual players in the world for every hardcore gamer, but hardcore gamers are willing to pay a lot more for games they care about. Both markets are totally valid, but they must be approached quite differently. The casual market, consisting of billions of people worldwide, can sound very appealing, but it can be very hard to get the attention of casual gamers, unless you get lucky and become suddenly fashionable (see <i>Flappy Bird</i>). Hardcore gamers, on the other hand, respond well to something that is well-crafted and deep. It can cost more to make games for them, but they are often willing to pay more as well. Whatever you decide, the key is to know who will care about your game, what they will pay for it, and why.</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec32_5"><span id="p542" aria-label=" page 542. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="pd_orange">Learn the Language</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Every business model has its own unique jargon that serves as shorthand for talking about how the game makes money. If you want the money people to take you seriously, learn their language. If you can speak it as well as they do, they will make a place for you at the table. Learn to speak it better than they do, and you will find them deferring to your design decisions every time. Here are some terms you should know.</p>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec32_5_1"><span class="pd_orange">General Game Business Terms</span></h3>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list"><b>SKU</b>: Pronounced &#8220;skew.&#8221; Stands for &#8220;stock keeping unit.&#8221; It means a unique inventory item for a store. One game might come out as many SKUs, since each different console release is a SKU and each language version (Halo 3 in French) is a SKU. Publishers often measure themselves in terms of how many SKUs they put out in a year.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>COGS</b>: No, not like cogs in a machine. This is cost of goods sold. That is, what does it cost, per unit, to actually make the game.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Burn rate</b>: What does it is cost, per month, to keep your studio open? Salaries, benefits, rent, etc.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Sold in vs. sold through</b>: When the retailer buys games from the publisher, they are &#8220;sold in,&#8221; that is, sold into the store. But when a customer buys the game, then we say it is &#8220;sold through.&#8221; Since the publisher has to buy back titles the retailer can&#8217;t sell, the number of sold-in and sold-through titles might be very different. If a boastful publisher brags to you that a title has sold 1.5 million copies, and it&#8217;s just been out for a week, you can often burst his bubble by asking &#8220;sold in or sold through?&#8221; In the end, only &#8220;sold through&#8221; matters.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Units sold</b>: Primarily important for retail and direct download games, this is simply how many times the game has been purchased. When pitching a new game, everyone will be trying to make determinations about how many units it will sell&#8212;often based on how well similar games have sold.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Breakeven</b>: How many units of the game have to be sold before the publisher makes back the money they put into the game. For example, if the game cost $400,000 to develop and market, and you collect $5 for every unit sold, breakeven will be at 80,000 units sold. Below that, you lose money&#8212;above that, you make profit.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec32_5_2"><span class="pd_orange">Free-to-Play Business Terms</span></h3>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list"><b>Churn</b>: What percent of players do you lose each month? Ideally, this number is zero. The bigger the churn, the worse your retention, and everyone will ask &#8220;What can we do to keep them playing?&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span id="p543" aria-label=" page 543. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><b>Cost of acquisition</b>: How much do you have to spend, on average, to get someone to download and play your game?</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>DAU</b>: daily active users. How many people played your game in the last twenty four hours? This is the easiest fact about an F2P game to measure, and obviously bigger is better, so DAU gets a lot of attention.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>MAU</b>: monthly active users. How many players played your game in the last month? Wait a second, shouldn&#8217;t this just be DAU&#8202;&#215;&#8202;30? No. If you have the same set of people playing your game every day, then your MAU will equal your DAU. If you have high churn, your MAU will be much greater than your DAU. Much is made of the MAU/DAU ratio.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>ARPU</b>: average revenue per user. Typically this is quoted monthly. In other words, figure out how much money is collected in the last thirty days, and divide it by your MAU, and that gives you your ARPU.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>ARPPU</b>: average revenue per paying user. That is, just looking at the players who pay money, how much to do they pay, on average? Like ARPU, this is also usually calculated on a monthly basis. This number will be higher (usually much higher) than your ARPU.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>LTV</b>: lifetime value. How much money are you making from the average player from when they first try your game till the time when they quit and never play again? This is a hard number to calculate, but it is very important, since it tells you how much you can safely spend to acquire new players. If the LTV of your average player is $5, it is a reasonable idea to spend $4 to acquire a new player, because eventually you&#8217;ll make a dollar from them. But if your LTV is $3, spending $4 would be foolish.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>K-factor</b>: This is a term borrowed from the world of viral marketing, who borrowed it from the world of medicine. It is simply this: How many other new players does your average player bring in? If your game is very viral, and everyone is getting their friends to play, your k-factor is high. A high k-factor is very important, because strong virality drastically lowers the cost of acquisition.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Whale</b>: This unflattering term refers to players that pay A LOT for F2P games. Some will pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars if it helps them succeed. F2P designers pay a lot of attention to whales, as they can constitute a significant percentage of revenues for a game. One study found that 50% of game revenue comes from only 0.15% of players. If 50% of your revenue comes from whales, and you just found a way to get the whales to spend double what they normally do, that&#8217;s a big deal.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">There&#8217;s lots more of these, of course, but I list these just to give you a sample. You see they really aren&#8217;t that complicated. If you can have some familiarity with this kind of language and are brave enough to ask for explanations when you hear terms you don&#8217;t know, the money people will start to respect you, because they&#8217;ll see you care about the things they think are important. And these things are important&#8212;without them, game design couldn&#8217;t be a career, only a hobby.</p>

<p class="noindent">Try this: for whatever platform you care about most, make a list, right now, of the top ten moneymaking videogames of the last year. After you make your list, go on the web and compare reality to your list. If you had a perfect match, good job. If not, you should think about why you were off base. Did you not realize that titles based on movie franchises were so popular? Did you forget about F2P games? Did you think Pok&#233;mon wouldn&#8217;t be on the list? Did you assume that the games you liked best were the games everyone else liked? I can guarantee you that any funder you pitch to can name the top ten games. Why? Because the game industry is a hit-driven business. Publishers make their money off of big hits, and so they study the hits scrupulously, in an attempt to understand what made them successful.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to understand how publishers think, you need to analyze the hits. One company, Electronic Entertainment Design and Research (<a href="http://www.eedar.com">www.eedar.com</a>), is taking this analysis to new levels by breaking games down feature by feature and performing complex mathematical analysis to try to understand which features contributed most to the financial success of each title. How much does multiplayer matter? How much do hours of gameplay matter? This is so developers and publishers can use these data for future titles.</p>
<p class="indent">However you do it, find some way to get familiar with the hits in your market and demographic and understand why they were so successful. It will help you build a common understanding with the money people. And if you have special insights as to why certain game designs made so much money, I can guarantee that the money people will want to hear what you have to say.</p>

<p class="noindent">When downloadable games that required no publisher became a reality, it was hailed by independent developers as massive win for the little guy. Surely, now, any little developer with a great idea could compete with the very biggest game publishers. And it was true! In the iOS market, for example, some game developers found they could earn a very comfortable living selling their homemade games for $6.99 in the app store. Soon, the world smelled the gold rush, and games started to appear by the thousands. And the prices started to drop: $4.99 became standard, then $3.99, $2.99, $1.99, then $.99, and finally, free. And ironically, in a market where the <span id="p545" aria-label=" page 545. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>standard price was free, the game makers with the best chance of making money on their games were the ones who could get millions and millions of players&#8212;and in a crowded market, that meant spending a lot on marketing, and so, once again, we have a situation that significantly favors large publishers. No longer is it a challenge to get your game into the store&#8212;the challenge now is to stand out among the thousands of competitors. This has made it necessary for everyone who creates games in these markets to think heavily (and often spend heavily) when it comes to marketing. Markets like this, which are flooded with suppliers, are often referred to as &#8220;red ocean&#8221; markets, conjuring up a picture of a fish-eat-fish world where there is a great deal of blood in the water. How to survive? Either be the biggest fish or go find a &#8220;blue ocean.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;Blue oceans&#8221; are places with relatively few competitors. Sometimes markets are like this because they are very new. But other times these are places where there are barriers that keep other people from entering. If you can get into one of these places, it can be very much to your advantage. At the present time, the iOS market is such a red ocean that 90% of games in the app store lose money, and only about 10% are profitable. Contrast that with the slot machine industry, which, due to government regulations, special hardware, special expertise, and dependence on special algorithms, is a very hard part of the videogame market to enter. In this market, about 90% of the games are profitable, and only about 10% lose money. Barriers make a huge difference to profitability, so if you can take advantage of them, you definitely should. Barriers come in many varieties&#8212;here are a few to consider:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list"><b>Technical barriers</b>: This can include special algorithms that make for new kinds of gameplay, or a new look and feel, or possibly a new kind of server technology that allows for unique multiplayer gameplay. Many games have had great success by solving difficult technical problems that others can&#8217;t easily replicate.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Hardware barriers</b>: If you have created a new kind of hardware platform, possibly even one protected by patents, it will be hard for others to quickly follow you. When Skylanders came out, for example, everyone agreed it was a good idea, but very few companies were able to create a competitive product.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Expertise barriers</b>: Maybe you know all there is to know about early childhood social&#8211;emotional learning, and you find there is a real market for games that help with that. People who don&#8217;t have your level of deep understanding will have a hard time competing.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Sales and distribution barriers</b>: I once cofounded a company that tried to sell training games to firefighters. We quickly realized that we would need a giant sales force to sell our software precinct by precinct. Other training companies already had sales relationships and sales forces in place&#8212;since we couldn&#8217;t afford to do that, we quickly got into a new business. If you have a special sales relationship (or can find a partner that does) with a certain market, think about how to take advantage of it.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span id="p546" aria-label=" page 546. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><b>Imagination barriers</b>: Anybody could have made Minecraft. It is not a very complicated game. But only one guy saw that making a game like that and selling it for a simple flat fee could work.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Relationship barriers</b>: Some games require a special partner, maybe for a movie or franchise license. If the licensor will only work with people they trust, that is a significant barrier that keeps others from competing, if you have a special relationship with them.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Uncertainty barriers</b>: Crazy new platforms are announced all the time. Sometimes everyone gets excited and jumps on them. Other times, developers are more uncertain. When the Microsoft Kinect was announced, most developers were skeptical that it would succeed. But a handful jumped the barrier of uncertainty and took a gamble on it, and when sales of it were unexpectedly high, they reaped the benefits of being one of very few games available for an unexpectedly popular platform.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Most people avoid barriers when they see them. They feel more comfortable following the crowd. But following the crowd means eventually fighting the crowd. Many successful developers have found that choosing the road less traveled by has indeed made all the difference.</p>

<p class="noindent">Profits keep the game industry alive. Ask these questions to help your game become profitable:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">Where does the money go in my game&#8217;s business model? Why?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">How much will it cost to produce, market, distribute, and maintain this game? Why?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">How much money will this game make? Why do I think that?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">What are the barriers to entry in the market for this game?</p></li>
