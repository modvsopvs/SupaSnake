<h2 class="h3" id="sec17_1"><span class="pd_orange">Story/Game Duality</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">At the dawn of the twentieth century, physicists started noticing something very strange. They noticed that electromagnetic waves and subatomic particles, which had long been thought to be fairly well-understood phenomena, were interacting in unexpected ways. Years of theorizing, experimenting, and theorizing again led to a bizarre conclusion: waves and particles were the same thing, both manifestations of a singular phenomenon. This &#8220;wave-particle duality&#8221; challenged the underpinnings of all that was known about matter and energy and made it clear that we didn&#8217;t understand the universe quite as well as we had thought.</p>
<p class="indent">Now we are well into the next century, and storytellers are faced with a similar conundrum. With the advent of computer games, story, and gameplay, two age-old enterprises with very different sets of rules show a similar duality. Storytellers are now faced with a medium where they cannot be certain what path their story will take, just as the physicists found that they could no longer be certain what path their electrons would take. Both groups can now only speak in terms of probabilities.</p>
<p class="indent">Historically, stories have been single-threaded experiences that can be enjoyed by an individual, and games have been experiences with many possible outcomes that are enjoyed by a group. The introduction of the single-player computer game challenged these paradigms. Early computer games were simply traditional games, such as tic-tac-toe or chess but with the computer acting as the opponent. In the mid-1970s, adventure games with storylines began to appear that let the player become the main character in the story. Thousands of experiments combining story and gameplay began to take place. Some used computers and electronics, and others used pencil and paper. Some were brilliant successes; others were dismal failures. The one thing these experiments proved was that experiences could be created that had elements of both story and gameplay. This fact seriously called into question the assumption that stories and games are governed by different sets of rules.</p>
<p class="indent">There is still much debate about the relationship between story and gameplay. Some people are so story-oriented that they believe that adding gameplay is guaranteed to ruin a good story. Others feel the opposite&#8212;that a game with strong story elements has been cheapened somehow. Still others prefer a middle-of-the-road approach. As game designer Bob Bates once told me: &#8220;Story and gameplay are like oil and vinegar. Theoretically they don&#8217;t mix, but if you put them in a bottle and shake them up real good, they&#8217;re pretty good on a salad.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Setting theory aside, and taking a good look at the game titles that people really enjoy, there can be no doubt that stories must do something to enhance gameplay, since most games have some kind of strong story element, and it is the rare game <span id="p317" aria-label=" page 317. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>that has no story element at all. Some stories are thick, epic tales, like the elaborate multihour storytelling of the <i>Final Fantasy</i> series. Others are incredibly subtle. Consider the game of chess. It could be a completely abstract game, but it isn&#8217;t&#8212;it has a gossamer thin layer of story about two warring medieval kingdoms. And even games with no story built in them at all tend to inspire players to make up a story to give the game context meaning. I played <i>Liar&#8217;s Dice</i> with some school-age kids recently, which is a completely abstract dice game. They liked the game, but after a few rounds, one of them said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s pretend we are pirates&#8212;playing for our souls!&#8221; which was greeted with enthusiasm all around the table.</p>
<p class="indent">Ultimately, of course, we don&#8217;t care about creating either stories or games&#8212;we care about creating experiences. Stories and games can each be thought of as machines that help create experiences. In this chapter, we will discuss how stories and games can be combined and what techniques work best for creating experiences that neither a gameless story nor a storyless game could create on its own.</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec17_2"><span class="pd_orange">The Myth of Passive Entertainment</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Before we go any further, I want to deal with the persistent myth that interactive storytelling is completely different from traditional storytelling. I would have hoped that by this day and age, with story-based games taking in billions of dollars each year, this antiquated misconception would be obsolete and long forgotten. Sadly, it seems to spring up, weed-like, in the minds of each new generation of novice game designers. The argument generally goes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="quote"><i>Interactive stories are fundamentally different from noninteractive stories, because in noninteractive stories, you are completely passive, just sitting there, as the story plods on, with or without you.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">At this point, the speaker usually rolls back his eyes, lolls his tongue, and drools to underline the point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="quote"><i>In interactive stories, on the other hand, you are active and involved, continually making decisions. You are doing things, not just passively observing them. Really, interactive storytelling is a fundamentally new art form, and as a result, interactive designers have little to learn from traditional storytellers.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">The idea that the mechanics of traditional storytelling, which are innate to the human ability to communicate, are somehow nullified by interactivity is absurd. It is a poorly told story that doesn&#8217;t compel the listener to think and make decisions during the telling. When one is engaged in any kind of storyline, interactive or not, one is continually making decisions: &#8220;What will happen next?&#8221; &#8220;What should the hero do?&#8221; &#8220;Where did that rabbit go?&#8221; &#8220;Don&#8217;t open that door!&#8221; The difference only comes in the participant&#8217;s ability to take action. The desire to act and all the <span id="p318" aria-label=" page 318. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>thoughts and emotions that go with that are present in both. A masterful storyteller knows how to create this desire within a listener&#8217;s mind and then knows exactly how and when (and when not) to fulfill it. This skill translates well into interactive media, although it is made more difficult because the storyteller must predict, account for, respond to, and smoothly integrate the actions of the participant into the experience.</p>
<p class="indent">In other words, while interactive storytelling is more challenging than traditional storytelling, by no means is it fundamentally different. And since story is an important part of so many game designs, game designers are well served to learn all they can about traditional storytelling techniques.</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec17_3"><span class="pd_orange">The Dream</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;But wait!&#8221; I hear you cry out. &#8220;I have a dream of beautiful interactive storytelling&#8212;a dream that rises above mere gameplay, a dream where a wonderfully told story is completely interactive, and makes the participant feel like they are in the greatest movie ever made, while still having complete freedom of action, thought, and expression! Surely this dream can&#8217;t be achieved if we continue to imitate past forms of story and gameplay.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">And I admit that it is a beautiful dream&#8212;one that has spurred the creation of many fascinating experiments in interactive storytelling. But so far, no one has come anywhere close to realizing this dream. But this hasn&#8217;t stopped people from creating interactive storytelling experiences that are truly wonderful, enjoyable, and memorable, despite the fact that they are somewhat limited in the structure and in the freedom they give the participant.</p>
<p class="indent">Shortly, we&#8217;ll discuss the reasons this dream hasn&#8217;t become a reality, and may never become a reality. But first, let&#8217;s talk about what actually works.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3">
<h2 class="h3" id="sec17_4"><span class="pd_orange">The Reality</span></h2>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4a" id="sec17_4_1"><span class="pd_orange">Real-World Method 1: The String of Pearls</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">For all the grand dreams of interactive storytelling, there are two methods that dominate the world of game design. The first and most dominant in videogames is commonly called the &#8220;string of pearls&#8221; or sometimes the &#8220;rivers and lakes&#8221; method. It is called this because it can be visually represented like this:</p>
<figure class="figure" id="fig17_2">
<figcaption>
<p class="title"><span class="pd_orange"><small>FIGURE</small><br/><b>17.2</b></span></p>
<img alt="" src="../images/fig17_2.jpg"/>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span id="p319" aria-label=" page 319. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The idea is that a completely noninteractive story (the string) is presented in the form of a text, a slideshow, or an animated sequence and then the player is given a period of free movement and control (the pearl) with a fixed goal in mind. When the goal is achieved, the player travels down the string via another noninteractive sequence to the next pearl, in other words, cut scene, game level, cut scene, game level.</p>
<p class="indent">Many people criticize this method as &#8220;not really being interactive,&#8221; but players sure do enjoy it. And really there should be little wonder at that. The string of pearls method gives the player an experience where they get to enjoy a finely crafted story, punctuated with periods of interactivity and challenge. The reward for succeeding at the challenge? More story and new challenges. Though some snobs will scoff, it is a neat little system that works very well, and it strikes a nice balance between gameplay and storytelling. While older games were sometimes ham-fisted with their approach, some newer games, such as <i>Ico</i>, <i>The Walking Dead</i>, and <i>The Last of Us</i> have shown how artfully the string and the pearls can be joined together.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec17_4_2"><span class="pd_orange">Real-World Method 2: The Story Machine</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">To understand this method, we have to take a good look at what a story is. It is nothing more than a sequence of events that someone relates to someone else. &#8220;I was out of gum, so I went to the drugstore&#8221; is a story, just not a very interesting one. A good game, however, tends to generate series of events that are interesting, often so interesting that people want to tell someone else what happened. From this point of view, a good game is like a story machine&#8212;generating sequences of events that are very interesting indeed. Think of the thousands of stories created by the game of baseball or the game of golf. The designers of these games never had these stories in mind when they designed the games, but the games produced them, nonetheless. Curiously, the more prescripting the designer puts into their game (like with the string of pearls), the fewer stories their game is likely to produce. Some videogames, such as <i>The Sims</i> or <i>Minecraft</i>, are specifically designed to be story generators and are very effective in this regard. Some critics say that these games don&#8217;t really count as &#8220;interactive stories,&#8221; because the stories have no author. But we don&#8217;t care about that, because all we care about is creating great experiences&#8212;if someone experiences something they consider a great story, and it has no author, does that diminish the impact of the experience? Certainly not. In fact, it&#8217;s an interesting question to consider which is more challenging&#8212;to create a great story or to create a system that generates great stories when people interact with it. Either way, this is a powerful method of interactive storytelling, and one that should not be ignored or taken for granted. The vast number of &#8220;Let&#8217;s Play&#8221; videos on YouTube and Twitch are testament that people like to share these stories. Use this lens to determine how to make your game a better story generator.</p>

<p class="noindent">A good game is a machine that generates stories when people play it. To make sure your story machine is as productive as possible, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">When players have different choices about how to achieve goals, new and different stories can arise. How can I add more of these choices?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Different conflicts lead to different stories. How can I allow more types of conflict to arise from my game?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">When players can personalize the characters and setting, they will care more about story outcomes, and similar stories can start to feel very different. How can I let players personalize the story?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Good stories have good interest curves. Do my rules lead to stories with good interest curves?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">A story is only good if you can tell it. Who can your players tell the story to that will actually care?</p></li>
</ul>

</aside>
<p class="indent">In terms of methods of interactive storytelling, these two methods surely cover 99% of all games ever created. What is interesting is how opposite they are from each other. The string of pearls requires a linear story to be created ahead of time, and the story machine thrives when as little story as possible has been created ahead of time. &#8220;But surely there is something in between!&#8221; I hear the dreamer cry. &#8220;Neither of these methods are the real, true dream of interactive storytelling! The first method is basically a linear path, and the second one isn&#8217;t really storytelling at all&#8212;it&#8217;s just game design! What about my vision of a wonderfully branching story tree, full of AI characters, and dozens of satisfying endings, so that a participant will want to enjoy it over and over?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">And this is a good question. Why isn&#8217;t this vision a reality? Why isn&#8217;t it the dominant form of interactive storytelling? The usual suspects (conservative publishers, a weak-minded mass audience, lazy designers) are not to blame. The reason that this vision isn&#8217;t a reality is because it is riddled with many challenging problems that <span id="p321" aria-label=" page 321. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>haven&#8217;t been successfully solved yet&#8212;and may never be solved. These problems are real and serious and deserve careful consideration.</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec17_5"><span class="pd_orange">The Problems</span></h2>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4a" id="sec17_5_1"><span class="pd_orange">Problem #1: Good Stories Have Unity</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Really, it is a simple thing to make an interactive story tree. Just keep making choices that lead to more choices that lead to more choices. Do that and you&#8217;ll get all kinds of stories. But how many of them will be enjoyable? What kind of interest curve will they have? One thing that we know about good stories is that they have intense unity&#8212;the problem that is presented in the first five minutes of the story is a driving force that has meaning all the way until the end. Imagine an interactive Cinderella story. &#8220;You are Cinderella. Your stepmother has told you to clean out the fireplace. Do you (1) do it or (2) pack your bags and leave?&#8221; If Cinderella leaves and, say, gets a job as an administrative assistant, it isn&#8217;t the Cinderella story anymore. The reason for Cinderella&#8217;s wretched situation is so that she can rise out of it dramatically, suddenly, and unexpectedly. No ending you could write for the Cinderella story can compare with the ending that it already has, because the whole thing is crafted as a unit&#8212;the beginning and ending are of a piece. To craft a story with twenty endings and one beginning that is the perfect beginning for each of the twenty is challenging, to say the least. As a result, most interactive stories with many branching paths end up feeling kind of watery, weak, and disconnected.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec17_5_2"><span class="pd_orange">Problem #2: The Combinatorial Explosion</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p class="quote"><i>I fear there are too many realities.</i></p>
<p class="right">&#8212;John Steinbeck, <i>Travels with Charley</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">It seems so simple to propose: I&#8217;ll give the player three choices in this scene, three in the next, and so on. But let&#8217;s say your story is ten choices deep&#8212;if each choice leads to a unique event and three new choices, you will need to write 88,573 different outcomes to the choices the player will make. And if ten choices sound kind of short, and you want to have twenty opportunities for three choices from the beginning to the end of the story, that means you&#8217;ll need to write 5,230,176,601 outcomes. These large numbers make any kind of meaningful branching storytelling impossible in our short life spans. And sadly, the main way that most interactive storytellers deal with this perplexing plethora of plotlines is to start fusing outcomes together&#8212;something like (<a class="figure" href="C20_chapter17.xhtml#fig17_3">Figure 17.3</a>):</p>
<p class="indent">And this certainly makes the storytelling more manageable, but look at what has just happened. For all the choices the player had (well, not that many here, really), <span id="p322" aria-label=" page 322. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>they all end up at the same place. How meaningful can these choices have been if they all lead to the same conclusion? The combinatorial explosion is frustrating because it leads to compromises on top of Band-Aids on top of compromises and ultimately a weak story. And you still have to write a lot more scenes than the player will ever see.</p>

<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec17_5_2a"><span class="pd_orange">Problem #3: Multiple Endings Disappoint</span></h3>
<p class="indent">One thing that interactive storytellers like to fantasize about is how wonderful it is that a story can have multiple endings. After all, this means the player will be able to play again and again with a different experience every time! And like many fantasies, the reality tends to disappoint. Many games have experimented with having multiple endings to their game story. Almost universally, the player ends up thinking two things when they encounter their first ending in one of these:</p>
<ol class="list-order">
<li><p class="list"><b>&#8220;Is this the real ending?&#8221;</b> In other words, the happiest ending, or the ending that is most unified with the story beginning. We all like to dream that we can find a way to write equally valid endings, but because good stories have unity, this generally doesn&#8217;t happen. And when players start to suspect they may be on the wrong track, they stop experiencing the story and start thinking about what they should have done instead, which defeats any attempt at storytelling. The string of pearls has a tremendous advantage here&#8212;the player is always on the correct story path, and they know it&#8212;any problem-solving action is surely a path toward a rewarding ending.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>&#8220;Do I have to play this whole thing again to see another ending?&#8221;</b> In other words, the multiple endings go against the idea of unity, and as much as we would like to dream that the gameplay would be significantly different if the player made different choices, it almost never is, and so the player now has to go on a long repetitive <span id="p323" aria-label=" page 323. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>trudge to explore the story tree, which probably will not be worth the effort and tedium, since there is likely a lot of repeated content upon a second playing (in an attempt to manage a combinatorial explosion), which will look pretty bad under <a href="C07_chapter4.xhtml#box4">Lens #4</a>: <i><a href="C07_chapter4.xhtml#box4">Surprise</a></i>. Some games have tried novel approaches to deal with this problem. The infamous game <i>Psychic Detective</i> (once summed up in a review as &#8220;One of the worst games ever made. Also, a masterpiece&#8221;) was a continuously moving 30-minute experience that always culminated in a final psychic battle with the villain, in which your powers were determined by the path you took through the game. As a result, to master the game, you had to play it through over and over again. Since most of the game consists of video clips, and the game tree has some significant bottlenecks that you must experience every time, the designers filmed multiple versions of the bottleneck areas, each with different dialog but containing the same information. As hard as the designers worked to solve the problem of repeated content (and many other problems), players generally found the process of replaying the interactive story somewhat tedious.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">There are exceptions, of course. <i>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</i> featured a novel type of player choice&#8212;did they want to play the game on the &#8220;light side&#8221; or &#8220;dark side&#8221; of the force, that is, with good or evil goals? Depending on which of the paths you choose, you have different adventures, different quests, and ultimately a different ending. It can be argued that this isn&#8217;t really a case of two different endings on the same story, but two completely different stories&#8212;so different that they are each equally valid. Players who try to take the middle path (the, uh, beige side of the force?) generally find the experience to be dissatisfactory.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec17_5_3"><span class="pd_orange">Problem #4: Not Enough Verbs</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The things that videogame characters spend their time doing are very different than the things that characters in movies and books spend their time doing:</p>
<ul class="list-simple1">
<li><p class="list-item"><b>Video game verbs</b>: run, shoot, jump, climb, throw, cast, punch, fly</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item"><b>Movie verbs</b>: talk, ask, negotiate, convince, argue, shout, plead, complain</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Videogame characters are severely limited in their ability to do anything that requires something to happen above the neck. Most of what happens in stories is communication, and at the present time, videogames just can&#8217;t support that. Game designer Chris Swain has suggested that when technology advances to the point that players can have an intelligent, spoken conversation with computer-controlled game characters, it will have an effect similar to the introduction of talking pictures. Suddenly, a medium that was mostly considered an amusing novelty will quickly become the dominant form of cultural storytelling. Until then, however, the lack of usable verbs in videogames significantly hampers our ability to use games as a storytelling medium.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec17_5_4"><span id="p324" aria-label=" page 324. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="pd_orange">Problem #5: Time Travel Makes Tragedy Obsolete</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Of all the problems that interactive storytelling faces, this final one is quite possibly the most overlooked, the most crippling, and the most insoluble. The question is often asked, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t videogames make us cry?&#8221; and this may well be the answer. Tragic stories are often considered the most serious, most important, and most moving type of story. Unfortunately, they are generally off limits to the interactive storyteller.</p>
<p class="indent">Freedom and control are one of the most exciting parts of any interactive story, but they come at a terrible price: the storyteller must give up inevitability. In a powerful tragic story, there is a moment where you can see the horrible thing that is going to happen, and you feel yourself wishing, begging, and hoping that it won&#8217;t&#8212;but you are powerless to stop this path toward inevitable destiny. This rush of being carried along toward certain doom is something that videogame stories simply cannot support, for it is as if every protagonist has a time machine, and anything seriously bad that happens can always be undone. How could you make a game out of Romeo and Juliet, for example, where Shakespeare&#8217;s ending (spoiler alert: they both commit suicide) is the &#8220;real&#8221; ending for the game?</p>
<p class="indent">Not all good stories are tragic of course. But any experience that met the qualifications of the dream of interactive fiction should at least have the potential for tragedy. Instead, we get what the narrator in <i>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</i> intones when your character dies: &#8220;Wait &#8212; that&#8217;s not what really happened&#8230;&#8221; Freedom and destiny are polar opposites. As such, any solution to this problem has to be very clever indeed.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="level3">
<h2 class="h3" id="sec17_6"><span class="pd_orange">The Dream Reborn</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The problems with the dream of interactive storytelling are not trivial. Perhaps, one day, artificial personalities so realistic that it is impossible to tell them from humans will be intimately involved in our story and game experiences, but even that does not solve all of the problems presented here&#8212;any more than a well-run game of <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>, where human intelligence is behind every game character, can solve all these problems. No magic solution is likely to solve all five at once. This is not a reason to despair; the reason the dream is a failure is because it is flawed. Flawed, because it is obsessed with story, not with experience, and experience is all we care about. Focusing on story structure at the expense of experience is the same sin as focusing too much on technology, on aesthetics, or on gameplay structure at the expense of experience. Does this mean we need to discard our dreams? No&#8212;we just need to improve them. When you change your dream to one of creating innovative, meaningful, and mind-expanding experiences and keep in mind these may need to mix and blend traditional story and game structures in untraditional ways, the dream can come true for you every day. We live in a sea of stories, but most people new to storytelling find it harder than they expect. The following tips and <a class="nounder" href="C21_chapter18.xhtml#chapter18">Chapter 18</a>: <a class="nounder" href="C21_chapter18.xhtml#chapter18"><i>Indirect Control</i></a>, address some interesting ways to make the story elements of your game as interesting and involving as possible.</p>

<p class="noindent">When developing a game that you hope has a compelling story, it can be very tempting to begin not by designing a game but by writing your story. There is something enticingly concrete about plotting out a story, with engaging characters and exciting events, something that draws in novice game designers, who find it easier to sketch out a story idea than to deal with complexities of game mechanics and psychology. But this path is fraught with terrible peril. It has ruined more games than any other mistake that I know of. I learned about the story stack from designer Jason Vandenberghe, who needed to explain it to me because I had fallen into its terrible trap, wasting time, resources, and almost destroying a game I cared about very much. It is because of this intense danger that I make this story tip #1.</p>

<p class="indent"><a class="figure" href="C20_chapter17.xhtml#fig17_4">Figure 17.4</a> shows the story stack in all its glory. It is not a complicated idea, simply a list of five important elements that comprise story games. But these elements are sorted in an important way: from least flexible (Fantasy, at the bottom) to most flexible (Story, at the top). Let us consider each of one these elements, and how they relate to each other, in order, starting at the wisest place.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Fantasy</b>: It sounds crazy to say that of these five elements, fantasy is the least flexible. After all, isn&#8217;t fantasy more flexible than anything? I can fantasize about anything I want! And while that is true, there is something terrifyingly inflexible about fantasies. Either a fantasy appeals to a player or it does not. There is no middle ground. A story game about a flying superhero makes sense&#8230; many people have that fantasy. But, a story game about being a professional dishwasher? You&#8217;ll have a much harder time keeping people interested, because that just isn&#8217;t a fantasy that most people have. It is important to begin your design with a strong fantasy&#8212;after all, one of the main reasons that people play games is fantasy fulfillment. If your fantasy fails to resonate with your players, everything else you do will be an <span id="p326" aria-label=" page 326. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>uphill battle. A clear statement of the central fantasy of your game is a rock upon which you can build something powerful.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Action</b>: Once you have your fantasy clearly articulated, you next want to think about what player actions are best suited to fulfilling that fantasy. In the development of <i>Pixie Hollow Online</i>, which was based in part on the Disney <i>Tinkerbell</i> movie, we had an initial design where players engaged in many of the actions from the movie. They could help animals, harvest items from nature, make gifts for other fairies, help famous fairies solve interpersonal problems, and many other things. We proudly brought this design to a focus group of young girls to gauge their interest. To our embarrassment, they said &#8220;these things seem interesting&#8230; but what I really want to do is fly!&#8221; We had overlooked flying as an important action, because it was of minimal importance in the movie script. It was just a way of transitioning from one activity to another. And so, in our design, flying only happened in cut scenes. But when we took a step back, it became obvious that to fulfill the fantasy of being a fairy like Tinkerbell, the primary game action should be flying. Thankfully, the girls set us straight while we still had time to make the change. In the final version of the game, players would fly constantly, during all of their activities, and we gave special attention to the feel of the flight, so that it would fulfill the fantasy in a delightful way.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Economy</b>: Now that you have a set of actions that solidly fulfill an appealing fantasy, now you need a system of progress that will reward those actions, especially those actions that best fulfill the fantasy. As we discussed in <a class="nounder" href="C16_chapter13.xhtml#chapter13">Chapter 13</a>: <a class="nounder" href="C16_chapter13.xhtml#chapter13"><i>Balance</i></a>, game economies are defined by earning and spending. The simplest game economies are really just about earning&#8212;earning points, earning access to the next level, earning a win. It is easy to reward the wrong things in your game. For example, maybe you create a game centered on the fantasy of being a ninja. You choose actions like throwing ninja stars, sneaking up on enemies, and striking enemies with a ninja sword, which help fulfill that fantasy. However, if you accidentally design levels where in order to win, players must tediously memorize the locations of hidden traps, you are rewarding actions that work against the fantasy of being a ninja. In the <i>Pixie Hollow Online</i> example, we wanted players to earn progress from many different tasks and be able to use the earnings to get new outfits to play dress-up with their fairy. But&#8230; should fairies have money? &#8220;Fairybucks&#8221; felt like they went directly against the fantasy of being a fairy. Something like a barter system felt like it would fit the fairy fantasy much better&#8230; and we implemented just that: a system of many currencies. A given fairy shop might offer a pair of slippers for five pine needles, a hair ribbon for two blueberries, and a dress for six lily petals. This created an economy that matched the fantasy of being a fairy, and encouraged the actions we wanted: players desiring these items would fly off on a scavenger hunt to find out where in Pixie Hollow they could earn what they needed.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>World</b>: Once you have your fantasy, your actions, and your economy in place, now you need a world where they make sense. We will talk more about this soon in <a class="nounder" href="C22_chapter19.xhtml#chapter19">Chapter 19</a>: <a class="nounder" href="C22_chapter19.xhtml#chapter19"><i>Worlds</i></a>, but in short, you need to create a place with rules where the economy you have created makes sense. If you&#8217;ve made a game all about running <span id="p327" aria-label=" page 327. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and jumping and collecting stars that the player trades in for magical items, you should have some explanation of where these stars came from and why the sellers of the magical items want the stars. And&#8230; where did the magical items come from, anyway? This set of rules about how your world works is not yet story&#8230; a story is a series of events. A world is a place that operates by certain rules. If the rules of your world do not match the rules of your economy, everything about your game will feel hollow and fake.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Story</b>: And, at last, here we are at the top of the stack. Now that we have a solid fantasy, actions that fulfill it, an economy that rewards those actions, and a world that justifies that economy, we are at last ready to develop our story. It should be a story that makes the world we&#8217;ve created make sense, and a story where the player actions and progress are important. As we&#8217;ll see in the next tip, story has an almost infinite flexibility to make even the strangest situations seem understandable and normal. Despite this flexibility, story still <i>always</i> wants to take over the story stack. When story gets its way, it will enslave the entire process of game design. Story should not be the master of the game but rather a willing servant, using its flexibility to create the greatest game experience possible. If ever you find yourself, or someone on your team, saying &#8220;we can&#8217;t do that&#8230; it goes against the story,&#8221; it is a clear signal that story has tricked you, trapped you, and taken over your game.</p>
<p class="indent">And this is why it is so important to respect the story stack. Wherever you begin with your design, you place a stake in the ground. Placing a story stake in the ground is foolish&#8212;because now, somehow, you will have to drag inflexible fantasy to where that stake has been placed. On the other hand, if you find a powerful, but inflexible fantasy, and put your stake there, then when you have built up the other elements, you can easily craft a story that explains why your stake is exactly where it is. And that leads us to story tip #2.</p>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec17_7_2"><span class="pd_orange">Story Tip #2: Put Your Story to Work!</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">As we discussed in <a class="nounder" href="C08_chapter5.xhtml#chapter5">Chapter 5</a>: <a class="nounder" href="C08_chapter5.xhtml#chapter5"><i>Elements</i></a>, it is possible to start a design in any corner of the tetrad&#8212;story, gameplay, technology, or aesthetics. And many designs begin with a story. Following that story too slavishly, at the expense of the other elements, is a common mistake&#8212;and an especially silly one, since story is, in some ways, the most pliable of all the elements! Story elements can often be changed with just a few words, where changing elements of gameplay might take weeks of balancing, and changing elements of technology might take months of reprogramming.</p>
<p class="indent">I once heard some developers of a 3DO game talk about some development headaches they were having. Their game involved flying over a planet in a spaceship and shooting down enemy ships. The game was 3D, and to maintain performance, they could not afford to draw distant terrain. To keep the terrain from looking strange when it popped in, they had planned to use the old trick of making the world foggy. But due to some quirk of the 3D hardware, the only fog they could make was a weird green color that looked completely unrealistic. Initially, the team assumed they <span id="p328" aria-label=" page 328. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>would have to scrap this solution, when suddenly, story to the rescue! Someone had the idea that maybe the evil aliens who had taken over the planet had done so by shrouding it with toxic gas. This little change in the story suddenly made a technical approach that supported the desired gameplay mechanic completely possible. As a side effect, it arguably improved the story, making the alien takeover seem all the more dramatic.</p>
<p class="indent">I had a similar experience developing my <i>Mordak&#8217;s Revenge</i> board game. My initial design for the gameplay required players to travel about the board, collecting five keys. When they had all five, they had to journey to the stronghold of the evil wizard Mordak to unlock the stronghold and battle him. In playtests, it quickly became clear that it would be a better game mechanic if Mordak could somehow come to the player who had collected the keys, since it was more immediate, and it meant that the battle against Mordak could be fought in a variety of terrains. But I was troubled because then the story didn&#8217;t make any sense. So, once again, story to the rescue! What if, instead, Mordak had a secret stronghold that no one could find? And instead of collecting keys, the players had to collect five summoning stones? When all five were collected, Mordak could be summoned immediately out of his stronghold and forced to battle the player in whatever terrain the player was currently in. This simple change to the story made the desired gameplay possible. It also was more novel than my somewhat trite &#8220;villain in the castle&#8221; story.</p>
<p class="indent">Always keep in mind how limber, flexible, and powerful a story can be&#8212;don&#8217;t be afraid to mold your story to support the gameplay you think is best.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec17_7_3"><span class="pd_orange">Story Tip #3: Goals, Obstacles, and Conflicts</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">It is an old maxim of Hollywood screenwriting that the main ingredients for a story are (1) a character with a goal and (2) obstacles that keep him or her from reaching that goal.</p>
<p class="indent">As the character tries to overcome the obstacles, interesting conflicts tend to arise, particularly when another character has a conflicting goal. This simple pattern leads to very interesting stories because it means the character has to engage in problem solving (which we find very interesting); because conflicts lead to unpredictable results, in other words surprises (which we find very interesting); and because the bigger the obstacle, the bigger the potential for dramatic change (which we find very interesting).</p>
<p class="indent">Are these ingredients just as useful when creating videogame stories? Absolutely&#8212;and maybe even more so. We&#8217;ve already discussed <a href="C15_chapter12.xhtml#box32">Lens #32</a>: <i><a href="C15_chapter12.xhtml#box32">Goals</a></i>&#8212;the goal of the main character will be the goal of the player and will be the driving force that keeps them moving along the string of pearls, if you choose to create one. And the obstacles that character meets will be the challenges the player faces. If you want your game to have a solidly integrated story, it is very important that these things line up&#8212;if you give the player a challenge that has nothing to do with the obstacles the main character faces, you have just weakened the experience considerably. <span id="p329" aria-label=" page 329. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>But if you can find a way to make the challenges of the game meaningful, as well as dramatic obstacles for the main character, your story and game structure will fuse into one, which goes a long way toward making the player feel like part of the story. We already have a Lens of Goals&#8212;here is its sister lens.</p>

<h2 class="box-title"><a href="C02b_tol.xhtml#rbox74"><span class="pd_whitez">#74 The Lens of the Obstacle</span></a></h2>
<p class="noindent">A goal with no obstacles is not worth pursuing. Use this lens to make sure your obstacles are ones that your players will want to overcome.</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">What is the relationship between the main character and the goal? Why does the character care about it?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">What are the obstacles between the character and the goal?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Is there an antagonist who is behind the obstacles? What is the relationship between the protagonist and the antagonist?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Do the obstacles gradually increase in difficulty?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Some say &#8220;the bigger the obstacle, the better the story.&#8221; Are your obstacles big enough? Can they be bigger?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Great stories often involve the protagonist transforming in order to overcome the obstacle. How does your protagonist transform?</p></li>

<blockquote>
<p class="quote"><i>Know your world as God knows this one.</i></p>
<p class="right">&#8212;Robert McKee</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">It is one thing to come up with a plot line, a list of characters, and a set of rules for a fantasy world. It is something else again to see it in your mind, as if it is a real place. To get there, you must think about it constantly, imagining you are one of the characters living in the world. One of the secrets of ride design at Disney is that each experience, such as the Haunted Mansion or Splash Mountain, has an elaborate <span id="p330" aria-label=" page 330. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>backstory that is not shared with the public, but all the designers know it and they use it to keep the world solid. Tolkien did not simply sit down and write The Lord of the Rings one day; instead, he spent years imagining and documenting the world of Middle Earth, its history, people, and languages before the stories really began to take shape. That level of detailed planning is seldom necessary, but if you can&#8217;t answer basic questions about the history of your world and the motivations of your characters, it will show in your work, and people will see it for what it is: unimaginative. Always remember: If it&#8217;s not real to you, it&#8217;s not real to them.</p>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec17_7_5"><span class="pd_orange">Story Tip #5: Provide Simplicity and Transcendence</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">One thing that game worlds and fantasy worlds tend to have in common is that they offer the player a combination of <b>simplicity</b> (the game world is simpler than the real world) and <b>transcendence</b> (the player is more powerful in the game world than they are in the real world). This potent combination explains why so many types of story worlds show up again and again in games, such as the following:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list"><b>Medieval</b>: The stream of swords and sorcery worlds seems to be never ending. These worlds are simpler than the world we know, because the technologies are primitive. But they are seldom accurate simulations of medieval times&#8212;there is almost always some kind of magic added, and this provides the transcendence. The continued success of this genre surely stems from the fact that it combines the simple and the transcendent in such a primal way.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Futuristic</b>: Many games and science fiction stories are set in the future. But these very seldom are any kind of realistic interpretation of the future we are likely to see&#8212;one with continued suburban sprawl, safer cars, longer work hours, and ever more complicated cell phone plans. No&#8212;the future that we see in these worlds is usually more of a post-apocalyptic future; in other words, a bomb went off, or we are on some strange frontier planet, and the world is much simpler. And of course we have access to sufficiently advanced technologies&#8212;which, as Arthur C. Clarke noted, are indistinguishable from magic&#8212;at least in terms of transcendence.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>War</b>: In war, things are simpler, since all normal rules and laws are set aside. And the transcendence comes from a powerful weaponry that lets participants become like gods, deciding who lives and who dies. It is a horror in reality, but in fantasy it gives a player powerful feelings of simplicity and transcendence.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Modern</b>: Modern settings are unusual for game stories, unless the player suddenly has surprisingly more power than normal. This can be accomplished in many ways. The Grand Theft Auto series uses criminal life to give both simplicity (life is simpler when you don&#8217;t obey laws) and transcendence (you are more powerful when you don&#8217;t obey laws). The Sims creates a simplified dollhouse <span id="p331" aria-label=" page 331. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>version of human life, and it gives the player transcendent godlike powers to control the characters in the game.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract worlds, such as Minecraft, are not only simpler than the real world; they are simpler than the average videogame! As Notch discovered, combining that simplicity with the godlike power to create and destroy can create a pretty successful game.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Simplicity and transcendence form a powerful combination that is easily botched. Use this lens to make sure you combine them just right.</p>
<aside class="boxed-text" epub:type="tip" role="doc-tip" id="box75">
<h2 class="box-title"><a href="C02b_tol.xhtml#rbox75"><span class="pd_whitez">#75 The Lens of Simplicity and Transcendence</span></a></h2>
<p class="noindent">To make sure you have the right mix of simplicity and transcendence, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">How is my world simpler than the real world? Can it be simpler in other ways?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">What kind of transcendent power do I give to the player? How can I give even more without removing challenge from the game?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Is my combination of simplicity and transcendence contrived, or does it provide my players with a special kind of wish fulfillment?</p></li>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec17_7_6"><span class="pd_orange">Story Tip #6: Consider the Hero&#8217;s Journey</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">In 1949, mythologist Joseph Campbell published his first book, <i>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</i>. In this text, he describes an underlying structure that most mythological stories seem to share, which he calls the monomyth, or hero&#8217;s journey. He goes into great detail about how this structure underlies the stories of Moses, Buddha, Christ, Odysseus, Prometheus, Osiris, and many others. Many writers and artists found great inspiration in Campbell&#8217;s work. Most famously, George Lucas based the structure of <i>Star Wars</i> around structures Campbell described, with great success.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="p332" aria-label=" page 332. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>In 1992, Christopher Vogler, a Hollywood writer and producer, published a book called <i>The Writer&#8217;s Journey</i>, which was a practical guide to writing stories using the archetypes that Campbell describes. Vogler&#8217;s book is not as scholarly as Campbell&#8217;s text, but it serves as a far more accessible and practical guide for writers who would like to use the hero&#8217;s journey as a framework. The Wachowskis, who wrote <i>The Matrix</i> (which rather clearly follows the hero&#8217;s journey model), are said to have used Vogler&#8217;s book as a guide. As accessible as the text is, it is often criticized for being over-formulaic and for shoehorning too many stories into a single formula. Nonetheless, many people find it gives them useful insights into the structure of heroic stories.</p>
<p class="indent">Because so many videogames revolve around a theme of heroism, it is only logical that the hero&#8217;s journey is a relevant structure for a powerful videogame story. Since several books and a plethora of websites already exist describing how to structure a story around the hero&#8217;s journey, I will only give an overview of it here.</p>
<section class="level5">
<h4 class="h5" id="sec17_7_6_1"><span class="pd_orange">Vogler&#8217;s Synopsis of the Hero&#8217;s Journey</span></h4>
<ol class="list-order">
<li><p class="list"><b>The ordinary world</b>&#8212;Establishing scenes that show our hero is a regular person leading an ordinary life.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>The call to adventure</b>&#8212;The hero is presented with a challenge that disrupts their ordinary life.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Refusal of the call</b>&#8212;The hero makes excuses about why they can&#8217;t go on the adventure.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Meeting with the mentor</b>&#8212;Some wise figure gives advice, training, or aid.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Crossing the threshold</b>&#8212;The hero leaves the ordinary world (often under pressure) and enters the adventure world.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Tests, allies, enemies</b>&#8212;The hero faces minor challenges, makes allies, confronts enemies, and learns the workings of the adventure world.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Approaching the cave</b>&#8212;The hero encounters setbacks and needs to try something new.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>The ordeal</b>&#8212;The hero faces a peak life or death crisis.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>The reward</b>&#8212;The hero survives, overcomes their fear, and gets the reward.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>The road back</b>&#8212;The hero returns to the ordinary world, but the problems still aren&#8217;t all solved.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Resurrection</b>&#8212;The hero faces a still greater crisis and has to use everything they have learned.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Returning with the elixir</b>&#8212;The journey is now well and truly complete, and the hero&#8217;s success has improved the lives of everyone in the ordinary world.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">By no means do you need to have all twelve of these steps in your heroic story&#8212;you can tell a good heroic story with fewer or more or in a different order.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="p333" aria-label=" page 333. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>As a side note, it is an interesting exercise to look at the hero&#8217;s journey through <a href="C19_chapter16.xhtml#box69">Lens #69</a>: <i><a href="C19_chapter16.xhtml#box69">Interest Curve</a></i>&#8212;you will see a familiar form emerge.</p>
<p class="indent">Some storytellers take great offense at the idea that good storytelling can be accomplished by formula. But the hero&#8217;s journey is not so much a formula, guaranteed to produce an entertaining story; rather, it is a form that many entertaining stories tend to take. Think of it as a skeleton. Just as humans have tremendous variety despite all of us having the same 208 bones, heroic stories can take millions of forms despite some common internal structure.</p>
<p class="indent">Most storytellers seem to agree that using the hero&#8217;s journey as a starting point for your writing isn&#8217;t a very good idea. As Bob Bates puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="quote"><i>The Hero&#8217;s Journey isn&#8217;t a box of tools you can use to fix every story problem. But it&#8217;s somewhat similar to a circuit tester. You can clamp the leads around a problem spot in your story and check to see if there&#8217;s enough mythical current flowing. And if you don&#8217;t have enough juice, it can help point out the source of the problem.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Better to write your story first, and if you notice that it might have something in common with elements of the monomyth, then spend some time considering whether your story might be improved by following archetypical structures and elements more closely. In other words, use the hero&#8217;s journey as a lens.</p>
<aside class="boxed-text" epub:type="tip" role="doc-tip" id="box76">
<h2 class="box-title"><a href="C02b_tol.xhtml#rbox76"><span class="pd_whitez">#76 The Lens of the Hero&#8217;s Journey</span></a></h2>
<p class="noindent">Many heroic stories have similar structure. Use this lens to make sure you haven&#8217;t missed out on any elements that might improve your story. Ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">Does my story have elements that qualify it as a heroic story?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">If so, how does it match up with the structure of the hero&#8217;s journey?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Would my story be improved by including more archetypical elements?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Does my story match this form so closely that it feels hackneyed?</p></li>

<p class="noindent">There is an old French saying that goes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="quote"><i>If you add a spoonful of wine to a barrelful of sewage,</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>you get a barrelful of sewage.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p class="quote"><i>If you add a spoonful of sewage to a barrelful of wine,</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>you get a barrelful of sewage.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">In some ways, story worlds are fragile like the barrelful of wine. One small inconsistency in the logic of the world, and the reality of the world is broken forever. In Hollywood, the term &#8220;jumping the shark&#8221; is used to describe a television show that has deteriorated to a point that it can never be taken seriously again. The term is a reference to the popular seventies show <i>Happy Days</i>. As a season finale, the writers had Fonzie, the most popular character in the show, jump over a line of school buses on his motorcycle. The episode was greatly hyped and had excellent ratings. In the next season, in an attempt to repeat this success, and to play off the popularity of the film <i>Jaws</i>, they had a waterskiing Fonzie jump over a shark. This was so ridiculous, and so far out of Fonzie&#8217;s character, that fans of the show were repulsed. The problem was not so much that one particular episode had a ridiculous premise, but rather that the character and his world were forever tainted and could never be taken seriously again. Here is another example: shortly after the release of <i>Mass Effect 3,</i> many players complained at their disappointment with the ending to the trilogy. The creators responded, announcing they were going to release a patch that changed the ending. This led to a massive uproar, proving that the quality of a story is less important than the illusion that it is real. One small error in consistency can make a whole world break apart, damaging its past, present, and future.</p>
<p class="indent">If you have a set of rules that define how things work in your world, stick with them, and take them seriously. If, for example, in your world you can pick up a microwave oven and put it in your pocket, that might be a little strange, but maybe in your world, pockets are magic and can hold all kinds of things. If later, though, a player tries to put an ironing board in their pocket and is told &#8220;that is too big for you to carry,&#8221; the player will be frustrated, will stop taking your story world seriously, and will stop projecting their imagination into it. Invisibly, in the blink of an eye, your world will have changed from a real, live place to a sad, broken toy.</p>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec17_7_8"><span class="pd_orange">Story Tip #8: Make Your Story World Accessible</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">In Jules Verne&#8217;s classic tale, <i>From the Earth to the Moon</i> (1865), he tells the story of three men who travel to the moon in a spaceship fired from a giant cannon. <span id="p335" aria-label=" page 335. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Despite the fact that the book goes into great detail about the science of the cannon, the premise seems ridiculous to modern eyes because any cannon blast powerful enough to launch a spacecraft would surely kill everyone inside. We know from experience that rockets are a far safer and realistic method of sending people to the moon. One might think that Verne did not use rockets in his story because they had not yet been invented&#8212;but this was not the case. Rockets were commonly used as weapons at that time&#8212;consider the &#8220;rockets&#8217; red glare&#8221; in &#8220;The Star-Spangled Banner&#8221; (1814), for instance.</p>
<p class="indent">So, surely Verne knew about rockets, and he seems to have had enough of a scientific mind to realize that they were a much more reasonable method of putting a craft into space than a cannon would be. So why did he write his story this way? The answer seems to be that it was much more accessible to his audience.</p>
<p class="indent">Consider the progressions of military technology over the course of the nineteenth century. First, consider rockets:</p>
<ul class="list-simple1">
<li><p class="list-item">1812: William Congreve&#8217;s rockets: 6.5&#8243; diameter, 42 pounds, two-mile range</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item">1840: William Hale&#8217;s rockets: same as Congreve&#8217;s but slightly more accurate</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">In nearly thirty years, rockets showed no growth and only slight improvement.</p>
<p class="indent">But now consider cannons:</p>
<ul class="list-simple1">
<li><p class="list-item">1855: Dahlgren&#8217;s gun: 100-pound shell, three mile range</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item">1860: Rodman&#8217;s Columbiad: 1000-pound shell, six mile range</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">In a mere five years, the size of a cannon shell had increased by ten times! Keeping in mind that the American Civil War was making international headlines in 1865, it only took a small leap of the imagination to picture even larger and more powerful cannons appearing within the next few years&#8212;possibly large enough to fire shells clear to the moon.</p>
<p class="indent">Verne surely understood that rockets were the most likely method of man reaching the moon&#8212;but he was a storyteller, not a scientist, and he had the good sense to know that when you are telling a story, facts aren&#8217;t always your friends. What the player will believe and enjoy is more important that what is physically accurate.</p>
<p class="indent">When I worked on <i>Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Buccaneer Gold</i>, several examples of this principle arose. One was the speed of the boat&#8212;initially, we took pains to make sure our pirate ship traveled at a realistic speed. But we quickly found that this speed was so slow (or appeared to be, at our height from the water) that players quickly became bored. So, we cast reality to the winds, as it were, and just made the boat go at a speed that felt realistic and exciting, even though it was not realistic at all. Another example can be clearly seen in this screenshot from the game:</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">Look at those boats and consider which way the wind is blowing. Weirdly, it seems to be behind all of them. And indeed it is. To ask players to understand how to sail a ship with the wind was simply too much to ask in an action game&#8212;and no player ever asked us about that; they simply assumed that the boats drove like cars or motorboats, because that is what they were familiar with. As a minor detail, consider the flags at the top of the ship masts&#8212;they are being blown in the opposite direction as the sails! The modeler of the ships initially had them facing the correct way, but it looked strange to our playtesters, who were more used to seeing a flag flying on a car antenna than on a ship&#8217;s mast. Our players would frequently ask why the flags pointed the wrong way, and we would explain: &#8220;No, see, the wind is blowing from behind the ships&#8230;&#8221; and they would say &#8220;Oh&#8230; hmm&#8230;. I guess that&#8217;s right.&#8221; But after a while, we got tired of explaining it, so we just made the flags point the other way, and people stopped asking about them, because now they looked &#8220;normal.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">There are times, though, that your story requires something strange that the player has never seen before, which can&#8217;t be made readily accessible. In these cases, it is very important that you call special attention to that thing and make the players understand what it is and how it works. I once had a team of students who made a little game about two hamsters in a pet store who fall in love but are unable to meet because they are in separate cages. Their game had the player use a little hamster cannon to try to launch the boy hamster to the girl hamster&#8217;s cage. It was pointed out to them that there is no such thing as a hamster cannon, and as a result the story seemed kind of strange and hard to believe. One solution would have been <span id="p337" aria-label=" page 337. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>to change the cannon to something else that could launch the boy hamster, like perhaps a hamster wheel, but the team wanted to keep the cannon, so they took a different approach. In the establishing shots of the pet shop, they prominently featured signs reading &#8220;Special! Hamster Cannons on sale!&#8221; This not only served as an intriguing hook for the experience, creating anticipation to see what a hamster cannon would look like, but it introduced this very strange item to the player so that when it showed up, it didn&#8217;t seem so strange after all&#8212;just a natural part of an unusual world. Surreal elements are not at all uncommon in games, and it is important that you understand how to smoothly integrate them. One handy way to do that is to use this lens.</p>

<h2 class="box-title"><a href="C02b_tol.xhtml#rbox77"><span class="pd_whitez">#77 The Lens of the Weirdest Thing</span></a></h2>
<p class="noindent">Having weird things in your story can help give meaning to unusual game mechanics&#8212;it can capture the interest of the player, and it can make your world seem special. Too many things that are too weird, though, will render your story puzzling and inaccessible. To make sure your story is the good kind of weird, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">What&#8217;s the weirdest thing in my story?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">How can I make sure that the weirdest thing doesn&#8217;t confuse or alienate the player?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">If there are multiple weird things, should I maybe get rid of, or coalesce, some of them?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">If there is nothing weird in my story, is the story still interesting?</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec17_7_9"><span class="pd_orange">Story Tip #9: Use Clich&#233;s Judiciously</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">One criticism videogame stories seem unable to escape is overuse of clich&#233;s, or tropes. After all, you can only save the world from evil aliens, use your wizardry against an evil dragon, or fight a dungeon full of zombies with a shotgun a certain number of times before it becomes tedious. This drives some designers to avoid any story setting or theme that has been done before&#8212;sometimes pushing their story <span id="p338" aria-label=" page 338. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and setting into something so offbeat that players are unable to understand what it is or relate to it at all.</p>
<p class="indent">For all their potential to be abused, clich&#233;s have the tremendous advantage of being familiar to the player, and what is familiar is understandable and comprehensible. It has been said that every successful videogame finds a way to combine something familiar with something novel. Some designers would never make a game about ninjas, because ninjas have been done to death. But what if you made a story about a lonely ninja, an incompetent ninja, a ninja dog, a robotic ninja, or a third-grade girl who leads a secret life as a ninja? All of these storylines have the potential to be something new and different while having a hook into a world the player already understands.</p>
<p class="indent">It is certainly an error to overuse clich&#233;s, but it is an equal error to exile them from your toolbox.</p>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec17_7_10"><span class="pd_orange">Story Tip #10: Sometimes a Map Brings a Story to Life</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">When we think of writing stories, we generally think of words, characters, and plotlines. But stories can come from unexpected places. Robert Louis Stevenson had no intention of writing what is considered his greatest work: <i>Treasure Island</i>. Obligated to entertain a schoolboy during a particularly rainy vacation, he and the boy took turns drawing pictures. On a whim, Stevenson drew a map of a fanciful island, which suddenly took on a life of its own:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="quote"><i>&#8230;as I paused upon my map of &#8216;Treasure Island&#8217;, the future character of the book began to appear there visibly among imaginary woods; and their brown faces and bright weapons peeped out upon me from unexpected quarters, as they passed to and fro, fighting and hunting treasure, on these few square inches of a flat projection. The next thing I knew I had some papers before me and was writing out a list of chapters.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Most videogames do not happen in world of words, but in a physical place. By making sketches and drawings of this place, often a story will naturally take shape, as you are compelled to consider who lives there, what they do, and why.</p>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec17_7_11"><span class="pd_orange">Story Tip #11: Surprise and Emotion</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Writing stories is hard. Getting them to emerge from games is even harder. But, generally, when stories are dull, it is because they lack surprise or emotion (or, yikes, both!). If you find that your game story is dull, take out your old friends, <a href="C05_chapter2.xhtml#box1">Lens #1</a>: <i><a href="C05_chapter2.xhtml#box1">Emotion</a></i> and <a href="C07_chapter4.xhtml#box4">Lens #4</a>: <i><a href="C07_chapter4.xhtml#box4">Surprise</a></i>, and point them at your story. You yourself might be surprised and emotional at how much they help.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="p339" aria-label=" page 339. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>So much more can be said about story that we cannot possibly cover it all here. But whatever you create, whether it be an abstract game with only the thinnest veneer of theme and setting or a vast epic adventure with hundreds of detailed characters, you are wise to make the story elements of your game as meaningful and powerful as possible. So, we end this chapter with a general-purpose lens, which can benefit any game as a tool for studying this very important quadrant of the elemental tetrad.</p>
