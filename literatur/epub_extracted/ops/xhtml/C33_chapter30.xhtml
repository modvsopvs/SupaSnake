<h2 class="h3" id="sec30_1"><span class="pd_orange">Who Cares What the Client Thinks?</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">In a perfect world, you, as a game designer, would only have to worry about pleasing two groups of people: (1) your team and (2) your players.</p>
<p class="indent">But this is not a perfect world, and in most cases, there is someone else you have to think about: your client.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes this client is a game publisher, sometimes it is a media company that holds the rights to a popular franchise, and sometimes it is just someone with no entertainment experience who has decided they need a game for some reason. Clients come in all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p class="indent">Why do you care what the client thinks? Well, unless you are making your game as a hobby or you are independently wealthy, the client is probably paying you to make the game. And if they don&#8217;t like the way things are going, it&#8217;s literally game over.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, you might expect that the client views you as an expert&#8212;after all, the client can&#8217;t make the game themselves&#8212;that&#8217;s why they came to you. And, naturally, you might then assume that the client respects your opinions about what is going to make the best game.</p>
<p class="indent">And sometimes that happens.</p>
<p class="indent">Or so I have heard.</p>
<p class="indent">But most of the time, your client is going to have very strong opinions about how the game should look, act, and play. And rightly so&#8212;they are paying for it, after all. Your ability to deal with these opinions is critical, and here is why. There are two kinds of game designers in the world: happy ones and cranky ones. The happy ones are either independently wealthy or good at dealing with the strong opinions of their clients. The cranky ones are not good at dealing with these strong opinions. This might sound glib, but I&#8217;m quite serious&#8212;your ability to build bridges of compromise that delight both you and your client is possibly the single greatest indicator of whether you will be happy as a game designer in the long term.</p>
<p class="indent">But why? What&#8217;s so bad about the strong opinions of a client? What if the client has smart opinions? This can happen&#8212;sometimes clients have opinions that are very thoughtful and wise&#8212;and it&#8217;s a wonderful thing. But there are other times <span id="p515" aria-label=" page 515. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>when the client will have opinions that are so idiotic, so foolish, and so hypocritical that it beggars belief. Some of the stupidest things you will ever hear in your life will come out of your client&#8217;s mouth, and somehow, you will have to deal with that. And a lot is riding on how you do: your relationship with the client, your reputation as a designer, your happiness, and your game.</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec30_2"><span class="pd_orange">Coping with Bad Suggestions</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Many designers, when they get a bad suggestion from a client, freeze like a deer in headlights, terrified of what to say. There are three ways to deal with this:</p>
<ol class="list-order">
<li><p class="list">Agree to the bad suggestion, for fear of displeasing the client. This is a disservice to your client and your game.</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Immediately tell the client why their suggestion is bad, so the client will be impressed with how wise you are. This usually backfires.</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Try to understand why the client is making this suggestion.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">Response number three is the right answer. When someone makes a bad suggestion, it doesn&#8217;t mean they are dumb&#8212;it just means they are trying to help. And most of the time, when one of these bad suggestions comes up, it is a solution to an unstated problem. This is a perfect time to pull out our old friend, <a href="C10_chapter7.xhtml#box14">Lens #14</a>: <i><a href="C10_chapter7.xhtml#box14">Problem Statement</a></i>! Because if you can figure out what problem the client is trying to solve with their suggestion, perhaps you can come up with a solution that does a better job of solving the problem, and the client will be thrilled.</p>
<p class="indent">As an example, there was once a racing game that was about halfway through development when the client came in for a review. After toying with the prototype for a few minutes, he looked at the team and said, &#8220;These cars need more chrome.&#8221; The lead artist looked at the designer in a panic&#8212;the models were mostly complete and had been approved by the client months ago. The lead engineer was similarly panicked&#8212;the performance was tough as it was and adding shiny chrome meant more drain on an already overworked CPU.</p>
<p class="indent">The designer could have said &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and he could have said &#8220;No,&#8221; but instead he said the only wise thing: &#8220;Why? Why do they need more chrome?&#8221; And the client&#8217;s response was surprising: &#8220;Well, as I was playing, I kind of felt like the cars weren&#8217;t as fast as they should be. I know changing the car speeds would probably be a lot of work for you guys, so I was just thinking that if you just put more chrome on the cars, it would make them look faster.&#8221; Now, this might sound like some pretty strange logic, but set that aside, and take note that the client was only trying to help! In fact, the team had the same feeling that the cars felt too slow and were going to bring that up. Their solution was a combination of making the cars move faster (easy) and lowering the camera viewpoint to make the perceived motion faster. They were able to make the changes with the client standing right there. He was <span id="p516" aria-label=" page 516. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>thrilled to see the improvement and also pleased to understand a little more about how a racing game is put together.</p>
<p class="indent">This was a straightforward case of The Lens of the Problem Statement saving the day. People&#8217;s brains work fast, and they tend to jump to solutions before they even are sure what problem they are solving. Most bad suggestions can be resolved by the magic words &#8220;What problem are you trying to solve?&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec30_3"><span class="pd_orange">Not That Rock</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">A completely different way that clients drive designers crazy is by the opposite of strong opinions: not knowing what they want. This is sometimes known as the game of &#8220;Not That Rock.&#8221; It works like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="speech">Client: Bring me a rock.</p>
<p class="speech">Designer: Okay, how about this one?</p>
<p class="speech">Client: No, not that rock.</p>
<p class="speech">Designer: Oh. Uh, how&#8217;s this?</p>
<p class="speech">Client: No, not that one, either.</p>
<p class="speech">(Repeat two hundred times.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">After ten or twenty rounds of this game, designers often become frustrated, shouting to anyone who will listen, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe this client! They have no idea what they want!&#8221; And that may well be true. But, really, if they knew exactly what they wanted, wouldn&#8217;t the game already be designed? A big part of the designer&#8217;s job is to help the client figure out what they want. This is just like listening to your audience&#8212;you must get to know the client better than he knows himself. Here&#8217;s the right way to play &#8220;Bring Me a Rock&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="speech">Client: Bring me a rock.</p>
<p class="speech">Designer: What kind of rock?</p>
<p class="speech">Client: I&#8217;m not sure&#8230; I don&#8217;t know much about rocks.</p>
<p class="speech">Designer: Well, what are you going to do with it?</p>
<p class="speech">Client: Oh&#8230; I was going to put it by my driveway and paint a house number on it.</p>
<p class="speech">Designer: Ah&#8230; I think I know a good one&#8230; Let me bring you a few to choose from.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">When you can manage to help a client figure out what they actually want, you are engaging in the design process and, at the same time, you are empowering your client by giving them an education they need. If you play the game right, the client will come away feeling smart, and you will have designed a game that meets their needs perfectly.</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec30_4"><span id="p517" aria-label=" page 517. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="pd_orange">The Three Layers of Desire</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">To really give your client what they want, you have to understand what is important to them&#8212;you have to care about what they care about and think how they think. Doing your homework to learn about the client, both personally and professionally, is time well spent. Do they care more about striking it rich quickly or slowly building a reputation for good games? Are they looking to get into a new market or to capitalize on an existing one? What do they think makes a good game? You can learn a lot about a client just by talking to them and asking what they want&#8212;but keep in mind that people don&#8217;t always tell the truth. When trying to figure out what a client wants, keep in mind that everyone has three layers of desire: words, mind, and heart.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, a client might come to you and say, with her words: &#8220;I want you to make a game for the Rittenhouse Foundation. The game needs to teach algebra to eighth graders.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">But in her mind, she might be keeping a secret: &#8220;Actually, I want to make a space-themed game that teaches geometry. I&#8217;ve got it all planned out how it should work. I&#8217;m only going along with this algebra thing because the Rittenhouse people think it&#8217;s important.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">But in her heart, she might be thinking something else entirely: &#8220;I&#8217;m tired of being the financial person. I want people to see I have a creative side.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Now, if you simply took her at her word, you might find, as the project proceeds, that she is fighting you on it and that she is taking it in directions that seem opposed to what the funders want, and overall, her behavior is quite strange. But if you are able to learn what is in her mind and, even better, her heart, you can possibly incorporate elements from this game she has been imagining and maybe find other ways to let her contribute creative ideas or at least take credit for them. If you are very clever, you can probably find a way to fulfill all three layers of desire&#8212;this is not a trivial thing, for when you have fulfilled someone&#8217;s heart&#8217;s desire, you may find you have a friend for life.</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec30_5"><span class="pd_orange">Firenze, 1498</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">I&#8217;d like to close this chapter with one of my favorite stories about dealing with clients. It happened in Florence, Italy, during the Renaissance. The city, years earlier, had purchased a very large, fine piece of marble for a sculpture, but an inexpert sculptor had set to work on it and gouged a great hole in the marble. The city lost confidence and fired him, and the great piece of marble deteriorated in the cathedral yard, exposed to the elements for many years. But in 1498, the mayor, Piero Soderini, went on a crusade to have something carved from the marble. He approached Leonardo da Vinci, but Leonardo had no interest in working with a damaged piece of marble. Besides, he remembered how the previous <span id="p518" aria-label=" page 518. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>sculptor had been treated and wasn&#8217;t interested in getting the same shabby treatment. But one sculptor did come forward&#8212;a young man of twenty-six named Michelangelo. The mayor was skeptical that someone so young would be qualified, but Michelangelo brought a prototype with him: a model made of wax that showed how he would carefully arrange the legs of the figure to deal with the fact that the marble was both thin and badly gouged. Soderini and the commissioners were impressed and awarded Michelangelo the commission to create a statue of David.</p>
<p class="indent">One day, as the statue was nearing completion, the mayor decided to drop by to see how the work was going. The statue of David is very large, fourteen feet tall. This means that to work on it, Michelangelo had to surround it with scaffolding. As Michelangelo was working away high on the scaffold, Soderini came inside the scaffolding for a clear view. Fancying himself an expert, he told Michelangelo that the statue was good, but clearly, the nose was too large.</p>
<p class="indent">It was obvious to Michelangelo that Soderini was standing far too close to the statue for a proper viewing angle, because, after all, everyone&#8217;s nose looks too big when you look straight up at it. But it was also obvious that Soderini&#8217;s words were not telling the whole story&#8212;he had deeper layers of desire. Instead of trying to give Soderini a lesson in perspective, Michelangelo invited him to climb up the scaffold where the two of them could fix the nose together. As Soderini was climbing, Michelangelo scooped up a little bit of marble dust in his pinky finger. When Soderini was at a proper viewing angle, Michelangelo put his chisel near the nose, gave it a few pretend taps with his hammer, and dropped the dust from his pinky to make it look like actual sculpting was in progress. After a couple minutes of this, Michelangelo stepped away and said, &#8220;Look at it now.&#8221; &#8220;I like it better,&#8221; replied Soderini, &#8220;you&#8217;ve made it come alive!&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">This may seem like a cruel trick on Soderini. But was it? Clearly, he came that day because he wanted some ownership of the statue&#8212;he wanted to be a creative partner. And he came away feeling he was. After this, if someone were then to criticize the statue, you can be sure that Soderini would be the first to come to its defense. I tell this story not to suggest that you lie to your clients, but rather to underline the importance of finding ways for them to feel like creative partners on your game. It is possible to do this without compromising your creative vision. Always keep in mind that the client has more to offer than just funding. It may be connections, business expertise, or a special understanding of the audience for your game. You will find that if you listen to your clients&#8212;truly, deeply, listen to them&#8212;they will listen to you.</p>

<p class="noindent">If you are making a game for someone else, you should probably know what they want. Ask yourself these questions:</p>

<li><p class="list">What does the client say they want?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">What does the client think they want?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">What does the client really want, deep down in their heart?</p></li>
