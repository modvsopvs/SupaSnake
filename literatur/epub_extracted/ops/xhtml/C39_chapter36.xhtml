<p class="noindent">My goodness! Look at the time! I&#8217;ve talked long enough to fill a whole book. Thank you so much for dropping in&#8212;I really do enjoy talking about these things with someone as thoughtful and insightful as you are. Say, what was that clever anagram you mentioned? If I mix up the letters in &#8220;art of game design,&#8221; it spells &#8220;ragged&#8230;&#8221; something? Oh, yes! Very clever! I&#8217;ll have to remember that!</p>
<p class="indent">You have your map? Your ring? And all your lenses? Good, good. No, really, you can keep them&#8212;as long as you promise to use them. You can find a helpful deck of lens cards by searching for &#8220;deck of lenses&#8221; on Amazon, or download the free &#8220;deck of lenses&#8221; app by doing the same search in the Android or iOS store. You can find more details at <a href="http://artofgamedesign.com">artofgamedesign.com</a>. And if you want to, you can keep track of my comings and goings at <a href="http://jesseschell.com">jesseschell.com</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Good luck with that game you mentioned&#8212;it sounds really fun! Let me know when we can try it out!</p>
<p class="indent">Thanks again for stopping by, and thanks so much for listening. Keep in touch, okay?</p>
<p class="indent">After all, we game designers have to stick together.</p>
