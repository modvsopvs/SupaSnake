<p class="quote"><i>It is well to remember that the entire universe, with one trifling exception, is composed of others.</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quote"><i>No one ever said on their deathbed, &#8220;Gee, I wish I had spent more time alone with my computer.&#8221;</i></p>

</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Man is a social animal. Humans generally avoid being alone whenever possible. In most cases, we don&#8217;t like to eat alone, sleep alone, work alone, or play alone. Prisoners who behave badly are put in solitary confinement, because, although being trapped in a cage with a dangerous criminal is bad, being alone is worse.</p>
<p class="indent">And, if you look back over the centuries, the history of game design reflects this. The majority of all games created are designed to be played with other players or against other players. Before the advent of computers, solo games, such as solitaire, were rare.</p>
<p class="indent">So what happened with videogames? A tremendous number of them are single-player experiences. But why? Is there something about the technology that makes us want to give up our natural human tendency to socialize? Of course not. In fact, the trends are clear&#8212;each year, more videogames have a multiplayer or community component of some kind. The explosion of Facebook games and asynchronously social mobile games is a massive blossoming of human nature. The single-player phenomenon appears to have been a temporary abnormality, born partly because of the novelty of single-player interactive worlds and partly because of the technological limitations of game software and hardware. Now that more and more game platforms are going online and becoming connected, it is becoming the case that games not featuring a multiplayer component are once again becoming the rare case. The more technology advances and technological novelty wears off, the more electronic games start to fit the ancient social molds humans have had for thousands of years.</p>
<p class="indent">Does this mean that a day will come when there are no single-player games? Certainly not. There are plenty of times that humans do want to be alone for a time&#8212;reading books, exercising, meditating, and doing crossword puzzles are all delightful solitary pleasures, and videogames have elements in common with all of these. But humans tend to spend more time social than solitary, and in the long run, games will do the same.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span id="p439" aria-label=" page 439. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Clearly, playing with other people is natural and, in fact, the preferred way for us to play games. But why? In this book so far, we have discussed dozens of reasons people play games: for pleasure, for challenge, for judgment, for rewards, for flow, for transcendence, and many more. Although some of those are enhanced by the presence of other players, none of them require that presence. What is it that we specifically seek when playing games with other people? There seem to be five main reasons:</p>
<ol class="list-order">
<li><p class="list"><b>Competition</b>: When we think of multiplayer games, competition is usually the first thing that comes to mind&#8212;and for good reason. It simultaneously fills several kinds of needs and desires for us. All at once, it</p>
<ul class="list-alpha-lower">
<li><p class="list-item">Allows for a balanced game on a level playing field (<a href="C16_chapter13.xhtml#box37">Lens #37: <i>Fairness</i></a>)</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item">Provides us with a worthy opponent (<a href="C16_chapter13.xhtml#box38">Lens #38: <i>Challenge</i></a> and <a href="C16_chapter13.xhtml#box43">Lens #43</a>: <i><a href="C16_chapter13.xhtml#box43">Competition</a></i>)</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item">Gives us an interesting problem to solve (<a href="C07_chapter4.xhtml#box8">Lens #8: <i>Problem Solving</i></a>)</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item">Fulfills a deep inner need to determine our skill level relative to someone else in our social circle (<a href="C14_chapter11.xhtml#box25">Lens #25: <i>Judgment</i></a> and <a href="C23_chapter20.xhtml#box90">Lens #90</a>: <i><a href="C23_chapter20.xhtml#box90">Status</a></i>)</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item">Allows for games involving complex strategy, choices, and psychology, all possible because of the intelligence and skill of our human opponent (<a href="C16_chapter13.xhtml#box39">Lens #39: <i>Meaningful Choice</i></a>, <a href="C15_chapter12.xhtml#box34">Lens #34</a>: <i><a href="C15_chapter12.xhtml#box34">Skill</a></i>, and <a href="C21_chapter18.xhtml#box79">Lens #79</a>: <i><a href="C21_chapter18.xhtml#box79">Freedom</a></i>)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Collaboration</b>: The opposite of competition, this is the &#8220;other way&#8221; we like to play together. Collaborative games are enjoyable to us because they</p>
<ul class="list-alpha-lower">
<li><p class="list-item">Allow us to partake in game actions and employ game strategies that are impossible with just one person (e.g., one-on-one baseball makes almost no sense)</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item">Let us enjoy the (presumably evolved) deep pleasures that come from group problem solving and being part of a successful team</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">And while some people think of collaborative games as experimental, that is only the case when players are collaborating against an automated opponent. Most collaborative games follow the mold of team sports, which allow all the pleasures of collaboration and the pleasures of competition at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Meeting up</b>: We like to get together with our friends, but it can be socially awkward to just show up and be forced to make conversation on a regular basis. Games, like food, give us a convenient reason to be together, give us something to share, and give us something to focus on that won&#8217;t make anyone in the room uncomfortable. Games are a great way for kids and parents to spend time with each other, and many are the friendships held together by a weekly game of chess, golf, tennis, bridge, bingo, basketball, or, more recently, <i>League of Legends</i>, <i>Call of Duty</i>, or <i>Words with Friends</i>.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span id="p440" aria-label=" page 440. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><b>Exploring our friends</b>: And while it is great to have an excuse to meet up with our friends, games let us do something else that we can&#8217;t do so easily with just conversation&#8212;explore the minds and souls of our friends. In a conversation, we hear a friend&#8217;s opinions about likes and dislikes and their stories about the way they and other people have behaved. But these things are all filtered through the friend&#8217;s conception of what they think we want to hear. When we play a game with them, however, we get a glimpse of something more like the unvarnished truth. We get to see them solving problems. We get to see them making tough decisions under stress. We get to see them make decisions about when to cut someone a break and when to stab them in the back. We learn who we can trust and who we can&#8217;t. As Plato purportedly said, &#8220;You can learn more about a man in an hour of play than a year of conversation.&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Exploring ourselves</b>: Alone, games let us test the limits of our abilities, finding out what we enjoy and learning what we want to improve at. But when we are with others, we get to explore how we will behave in complex social situations, under stress. Do we have a tendency to let our friends win when they have a bad day, or to crush them unconditionally? Who do we prefer to team with, and why? How do we feel when publicly defeated, and how do we cope with that? How do our strategies differ from others, and why? Who do we choose to imitate, or find ourselves imitating? All these questions, and many others, are explored when we play games with other people. These are not trivial things&#8212;they are important things, close to the heart of how we see ourselves and how we relate to other people.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">And it is worth noting that for some of these it isn&#8217;t even necessary for everyone to play. There can be a good social connection just watching someone else play a game. For that reason, it becomes very important to think about how you design for spectators. In a venue like the hearth (living room), this is particularly important, because there are likely to be others around who would rather be watching television. If you can make your game such a compelling spectacle that they&#8217;d rather watch it&#8212;laughing, kibbutzing, and helping the players solve hard problems&#8212;you&#8217;ve done something really worthwhile. Further, more and more people are watching gameplay remotely through streamed videos. Spectation is an easy perspective to forget, so let&#8217;s be sure to add it to our collection.</p>

<h2 class="box-title"><a href="C02b_tol.xhtml#rbox95"><span class="pd_whitez">#95 The Lens of Spectation</span></a></h2>
<p class="noindent">For thousands of years, man has loved to sit and watch others play games&#8212;but only if the games are worth watching. To make your game spectator worthy, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list"><span id="p441" aria-label=" page 441. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Is my game interesting to watch? Why or why not?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">How can I make it more interesting to watch?</p></li>

<p class="indent">A new risk appears with multiplayer games that is less important when someone plays alone: cheating. Players who cheat in isolation are only cheating themselves. But cheating amongst or against other players is meaningful breach of social contract. If the cheater is caught, others will shame them. This can harm your game in two different ways. First, if your game has loopholes in it that encourage players to cheat, it creates stress for the players, who need to keep an eye out for cheating behavior. But cheatable games suffer a much worse problem as well: if players realize that cheating is possible, and they can&#8217;t tell if other players are cheating or not, it makes the non-cheaters want to stop playing because they worry that they can&#8217;t win if they don&#8217;t cheat, and who wants to lose to a cheater? This is an important perspective in all kinds of multiplayer and social games. Take this lens to help you make your game uncheatable.</p>

<h2 class="box-title"><a href="C02b_tol.xhtml#rbox95a"><span class="pd_whitez">#95&#189; The Lens of Cheatability</span></a></h2>
<p class="noindent">No one wants to worry about being beaten by a cheater&#8212;it makes you feel like a chump. To make sure your players trust your game, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">Can players cheat at my game? How?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">If players can cheat, will anyone notice?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Do players trust my game?</p></li>

<p class="indent"><span id="p442" aria-label=" page 442. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Although multiplayer gameplay is important, you must employ it carefully and wisely, because it can be a lot of work and hard to control. Generally, it is safe to assume that a multiplayer online game will take four times the effort and expense to create compared to a similar single-player game. This is because multiplayer games are much more difficult to debug and to balance. The payoffs can be worth it, though&#8212;if the reasons for having the multiplayer gameplay are clear and certain. If the reason to add it is &#8220;because multiplay is cool,&#8221; you should probably think it through a little more.</p>
<p class="indent">There are many different, powerful reasons that we like to play games with other people. One additional reason, more powerful than the ones listed here, is the topic of our next chapter.</p>
