<p class="noindent">Games are something that inspires real passion in players, so it is not surprising that frequently, communities arise around games. These can be communities of <b>fans</b>, as in professional sports, or communities of <b>players</b>, as in <i>World of Warcraft</i> and <i>Fortnite</i>, or communities of <b>designers</b>, as in <i>Minecraft</i> and <i>Little Big Planet</i>. These communities can be very powerful forces, extending the life of a game by many years by constantly drawing in new players.</p>
<p class="indent">But what is a community, really? The answer is not so simple. It is not merely a group of people who know each other or who do the same thing. You might ride the train with the same people every day but never feel a sense of community in doing so. But you might feel a sense of community with total strangers who are fans of the same esoteric TV series that you love. There is a special feeling that goes with being part of a community. It is hard to describe, but we know it when we feel it. Two psychologists who set out to better understand this sense of community found that it has four primary elements:</p>
<ol class="list-order">
<li><p class="list"><b>Membership</b>: Something distinct makes it clear you are part of this group.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Influence</b>: Being part of this group gives you power over something.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Integration and fulfillment of needs</b>: Being part of this group does something for you.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Shared emotional connection</b>: You have some guarantee of sharing emotions about certain events with others in the group.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">And while these four are unquestionably important aspects of community, I find I sometimes prefer designer Amy Jo Kim&#8217;s succinct definition of community: a group of people with a shared interest, purpose, or goal who get to know each other better over time.</p>
<p class="indent">But why, as a game designer, do you want communities to form around your game? There are three main reasons:</p>
<ol class="list-order">
<li><p class="list"><b>Being part of a community fills a social need</b>: People need to feel a part of something, and as <a href="C14_chapter11.xhtml#box22">Lens #22</a>: <i><a href="C14_chapter11.xhtml#box22">Needs</a></i>, shows us, social needs are very powerful.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Longer &#8220;period of contagion&#8221;</b>: The personal recommendation of a friend is the most influential factor when purchasing a game. Game designer Will Wright once pointed out that if we truly believe that interest in a game spreads like a virus, it makes sense to study epidemiology. And one thing that we know from epidemiology is that when the period of contagion doubles, the number of people who catch the disease can increase by ten times. &#8220;Catching the disease&#8221; in our case means buying the game. But what does &#8220;period of contagion&#8221; for a game mean? It is the time when a player is so excited about a game that they are talking about it constantly with everyone they know. Players who become part of a <span id="p445" aria-label=" page 445. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>game community are likely to &#8220;stay contagious&#8221; for a long time, as the game will become a deeper part of their lives, giving them a lot to talk about. Will was, as usual, ahead of the curve, as virality is now seen as a key component for success in social and mobile games.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>More hours of play</b>: It is often the case that players start to play a game for the game&#8217;s pleasures but stay with it over a long period for the community&#8217;s pleasures. I took a mountain vacation with a friend and his extended family once, and on the way there, he told me about a card game that his family loved playing. That evening, after dinner, the whole clan gathered around a big table to play, and I was quite eager to learn what it was about this unfamiliar game that they liked so well. They explained the rules, which were mind bogglingly simple&#8212;they basically consisted of passing cards to the right until all the cards were sorted in order. There were few decisions to make, and almost no skill whatever was required. Sometimes, it was hard even to say who won. I was incredibly disappointed, but as I looked around the table, I was the only one. Everyone else was talking, joking, and laughing as they played&#8212;and suddenly I realized that it didn&#8217;t matter that the game wasn&#8217;t perfect&#8212;what mattered was that it held them at the table and let them enjoy each other&#8217;s company, keeping their hands busy but their minds free. A game that has the ability to engender community will get played for a long, long time, no matter how lacking its other qualities might be. If the financial success of your game relies on subscription renewals, selling sequels, or microtransactions, the fact that community makes people want to play it longer becomes very important.</p></li>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec25_2"><span class="pd_orange">Ten Tips for Strong Communities</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Community is complex and involves many different interrelated psychological phenomena, but there are some basic things you can do to help foster a community around your game.</p>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec25_2_1"><span class="pd_orange">Community Tip #1: Foster Friendships</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The idea of online friendships seems simple. Just like real friendships, but online, right? But what do we really understand about the nature of friendship? And how can we translate it to a game environment? To have a meaningful online relationship with another person requires three things:</p>
<ol class="list-order">
<li><p class="list"><b>The ability to talk</b>: This sounds obvious. But a surprising number of online games have been created that offer players no ability to talk to each other&#8212;the designers hoping that some kind of nonverbal communication would happen through play and that would be enough. It is not enough. For a community to form, players must be able to speak to each other freely.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span id="p446" aria-label=" page 446. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><b>Someone worth talking to</b>: You cannot assume that all your players will want to talk to each other, any more than you can assume that strangers on a bus will mingle. The explosion of social media has shown us that most people are mainly interested in connecting with (1) their friends and (2) celebrities. You must have a clear understanding of who your players want to talk to and why. This varies a great deal depending on your demographics. Adults often want to talk to others who can relate to their problems. Teenagers often seek members of another gender or other people more interesting than their regular friends. And children generally have little interest in strangers&#8212;they would prefer to socialize with friends from real life. But understanding these age-based generalizations is not enough&#8212;you must understand the types of socialization that are specific to your game. Do your players seek competitors? Collaborators? Assistants? Quick chats or long-term relationships? If players can&#8217;t find the people they are interested in talking to, they will quickly drift away.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Something worth talking about</b>: The first two items could be satisfied by a good chat room. Games that foster community give the players a steady stream of things to talk about. This can come from the gameplay itself (games like <i>Words with Friends</i> and <i>Draw Something</i> have different content every time you play), depth of strategy inherent in the game (e.g., strategy discussion is a prime topic for chess communities) or from events, or rule changes that are introduced over time (typical topics of conversation in Massively Multiplayer Online games [MMOs] and Collectible Card Games [CCGs]). It is common to hear people say that &#8220;good online games are more community than game,&#8221; but this isn&#8217;t really true. Good online games must have a solid balance of community and game. If the game isn&#8217;t interesting enough, the community doesn&#8217;t have anything to talk about. On the other hand, if the community support for your game isn&#8217;t good enough, players will enjoy the game, but eventually wander off.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">Plenty of games are designed to just be played with your friends. But what about making new friends in your game? Friendships have three distinct phases, and your game must also have good support for each of them if you want friendships to blossom and survive:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list"><b>Friendship phase 1: Breaking the ice</b>. Before two people can become friends, they first must meet. Meeting people for the first time is awkward. Ideally, your game will have a way that people can easily find the kind of people they might like to be friends with and then have some way to engage with them that is low in social pressure but allows them to express themselves a little, so others can see what they are like.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Friendship phase 2: Becoming friends</b>. The moment when two people &#8220;become friends&#8221; is mysterious and subtle&#8212;but it almost always involves conversation about something both of them care about. And in games, that conversation is <span id="p447" aria-label=" page 447. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>often about a gameplay experience the two friends just shared. Giving players opportunities to chat with each other after an intense play experience is one of the best ways to encourage the formation of friendships. It can be a good idea to create a friend-making ritual in your game, such as inviting another player to be on your &#8220;friends list.&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Friendship phase 3: Staying friends</b>. Meeting people and making friends is one thing&#8212;staying friends is another. To stay friends with someone, you must be able to find them again to continue your friendship. In the real world, this is mostly up to the friends, but in online games, you need to give people some way they can find each other again. This might be through friends lists, or guilds, or even through memorable nicknames. Whatever works! But you have to do something, or your game misses out on the power of friendship, which is the glue that holds communities together.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Do keep in mind that different people are interested in different kinds of friendships. Adults are often most interested in making friends with similar interests, while kids are more interested in playing games with their real-life friends. Friendship is so crucial to community, and to gameplaying in general, that it deserves its own lens.</p>

<h2 class="box-title"><a href="C02b_tol.xhtml#rbox96"><span class="pd_whitez">#96 The Lens of Friendship</span></a></h2>
<p class="noindent">People love to play games with friends. To make sure your game has the right qualities to let people make and keep friendships, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">What kind of friendships are my players looking for?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">How do my players break the ice?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Do my players have enough chance to talk to each other? Do they have enough to talk about?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">When is the moment they become friends?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">What tools do I give the players to maintain their friendships?</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Online game pioneer Jonathan Baron makes the point that conflict is at the heart of all communities. A sports team becomes a strong community because they have conflict with other teams. A parent/teacher association becomes a community when they are fighting for better schools. A group of vintage car fanatics become a community in their shared battle against entropy. Fortunately for us, conflict is a natural part of games. But not all game conflict results in community. The conflict in solitaire, for example, doesn&#8217;t do much to create a community. The conflict in your game must either spur players to demonstrate that they are better than everyone else (conflict against other players) or be the kind of conflict that is more likely to be resolved when people work together (conflict against the game). Many games build community on both of these kinds of conflict: collectible card games, for example, are all about being the very best player in your community, but their strategies are so complex that players spend a lot of time sharing and discussing strategies. Similarly, <i>Minecraft</i> is about working together to build things but also about being the best player in the community.</p>

<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec25_2_3"><span class="pd_orange">Community Tip #3: Use Architecture to Shape Your Community</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">In some neighborhoods, people don&#8217;t really know their neighbors. In others, everyone knows everyone else, and the whole neighborhood has a sense of community. Is this because the people are different? No. It is usually a side effect of how the neighborhoods are designed. Neighborhoods that are designed to be walkable (and with meaningful destinations to walk to) give neighbors a chance to communicate. And neighborhoods with a lot of dead-end streets tend not to have a lot of through traffic, so that when you see someone passing by, there is a good chance you will know them. In other words, there are frequent opportunities to see and talk with the same people over and over again. Online worlds can support these same design features, partly through buddy lists and guilds, but partly by creating places where people are likely to see each other again and again and still have time to talk. Many MMOs have areas where people tend to casually congregate and chat&#8212;these areas are often at a place where many players pass by regularly on their way to some important game business.</p>

<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec25_2_4"><span class="pd_orange">Community Tip #4: Create Community Property</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">When you can create things in your game that are not just owned by an individual player but by several, it can really encourage players to band together. Perhaps, for example, no individual player can afford to buy a ship in your game, but a group could team up and own it together. This group practically becomes an instant community, since they have to communicate frequently and be friendly to each other. The tremendous success of <i>Eve Online</i> is largely based on community <span id="p449" aria-label=" page 449. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>property. The property you create doesn&#8217;t need to be so tangible&#8212;a guild&#8217;s status, for example, is a type of community property.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec25_2_5"><span class="pd_orange">Community Tip #5: Let Players Express Themselves</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Self-expression is very important in any multiplayer game. And while it is certainly true that players can express themselves through their gameplay strategies and styles of play, why stop there? You are, after all, creating a fantasy world where players can be whatever they would like to: why not let them express that? Rich, expressive avatar creation systems are much beloved by players of online games. So are systems of conversation that allow players to convey emotion or choose colors and styles for their text to display. The purchase of &#8220;vanity items&#8221; in online games is a key part of monetization for games ranging from <i>League of Legends</i> to <i>Color Switch</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">Player expression is not limited to online games&#8212;consider the expressive power in charades or <i>Pictionary</i>. Game designer Shawn Patton once created a board game all about being a kid trying to have fun without getting dirty. Whenever you got dirty, you had to color your dirt onto your character card. Players had great fun making up stories about how they got dirty and coloring their characters to match the story. Even <i>Monopoly</i> allows the players expression&#8212;although it is for only 2&#8211;8 players, the game has 12 different playing pieces, because it is an easy way to make sure players get a chance to express themselves.</p>
<p class="indent">Self-expression is extremely important but easily overlooked. Keep this lens so you remember to let players express themselves.</p>
<aside class="boxed-text" epub:type="tip" role="doc-tip" id="box97">
<h2 class="box-title"><a href="C02b_tol.xhtml#rbox97"><span class="pd_whitez">#97 The Lens of Expression</span></a></h2>
<p class="noindent">When players get a chance to express themselves, it makes them feel alive, proud, important, and connected. To use this lens, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">How am I letting players express themselves?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">What ways am I forgetting?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Are players proud of their identity? Why or why not?</p></li>

<p class="noindent">It is important to realize that when designing a game community, you are really designing three separate games for players at different levels of experience. Some might argue there are even more, but there are at the minimum these three:</p>
<ol class="list-order">
<li><p class="list"><b>Level 1: The newbie</b>. Players who are new to game communities are often overwhelmed. They aren&#8217;t yet challenged by the game itself&#8212;they are challenged just by learning to play the game. In a sense, learning to play the game is the game for them&#8212;and so you are obligated to design that learning process so that it is as rewarding as possible. If you don&#8217;t, newbies will give up on the game before they really get into it, and you will significantly limit your audience. One of the best ways to make newbies feel rewarded and connected to the game is to create situations where they get to interact meaningfully with more experienced players. Some experienced players like greeting and teaching newbies for their own enjoyment, but if not enough of your players tend to do this, then why not give in-game rewards for helping newbies? An online version of <i>Battletech</i> did this indirectly in an interesting way&#8212;experienced players took the role of generals and had to recruit their own armies. Newbies were honored to be asked and further honored to be placed right where the action is&#8212;on the front line, a place more experienced players learned to avoid. Even though the newbies would generally get slaughtered, it was win-win, in a way&#8212;the generals got lots of &#8220;cannon fodder,&#8221; and the new players got a taste of the action right away.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Level 2: The player</b>. The player is past the newbie stage. They completely understand the game and are immersed in the game activities and in figuring out how to master them. Most of the design that goes into the game is aimed at this group.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Level 3: The elder</b>. For many games, particularly for any online game involving some kind of &#8220;leveling&#8221; system, there comes a point where the game itself is no longer interesting. Most of the secrets have been discovered, and many of the game pleasures have been squeezed dry. When players reach this state, they tend to leave, seeking a new game with new secrets. Some games, however, manage to retain these elder players by giving them an entirely different game to play&#8212;one that befits their level of skill, expertise, and devotion to the game. There is tremendous benefit to keeping elders around, since they are often some of the most vocal advertisers of your game and, further, they are experts about your game, often able to teach you how to improve it. Some typical &#8220;elder games&#8221; include the following:</p>
<ul class="list-alpha-lower">
<li><p class="list-item"><b>A more difficult game</b>: Often, particularly in MMOs, the middle game is about gradual, clear progression toward a goal: when the goal is reached, then what? Sometimes a different kind of game is presented to the higher-level players, which is much more difficult&#8212;so difficult, in fact, that no one can ever consistently master it. In <i>Toontown Online</i>, &#8220;Cog Headquarters&#8221; <span id="p451" aria-label=" page 451. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>areas that featured a new, platform-based gameplay and new battle system served this purpose. Some games let you rise in the ranks from soldier to general. Other games change from pitting you against the computer to pitting you against the other players. There are many ways to add a more difficult game&#8212;but you are always left with the question: what to do when elders get tired of it?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item"><b>Governance privileges</b>: Some games give the elder players special levels of responsibility, such as deciding the rules of the game. Many Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs) gave elder players these kinds of powers. It is a great way to keep the elders involved and make them feel special, although you run some risk if you hand them too much control. Collectible card communities often have formal systems where experienced players can take tests to become official judges at game tournaments.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item"><b>The joy of creation</b>: Players who truly love a game often fantasize about extending it in new ways, particularly when they have grown tired of it. So, why not let them? Games like <i>The Sims</i> and <i>Skyrim</i> have built strong communities by letting players create and share their own content. Many elders get to the point where they play the games only occasionally but spend most of their time creating new content. For them, the new game becomes one of status: can they become the most popular and respected designer?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item"><b>Guild management</b>: When players form groups, these groups often benefit from having organizers. Elders will often do this on their own, but if you give them a strong set of tools to help run their guild, the activity will be all the more appealing to them.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item"><b>A chance to teach</b>: Just as many experts in real-world activities enjoy a chance to teach, so do game experts. If you can give them both permission and encouragement to do so, some of them will enjoy serving as ambassadors to the newbies and guides to the regular players. Some online games, such as <i>Entropia Universe</i>, give elders who would like to teach special status noting them as experts and teachers, which is something they are generally very proud of.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">These three levels might sound like a lot of work, but really, they can often be implemented quite simply. Every year at Easter, for example, my neighborhood hosts an egg hunt for all the kids who live there. Quite naturally, they have found that it works best to have three levels of play:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list"><b>Level 1&#8212;ages 2&#8211;5 (newbies)</b>: These kids hunt for eggs in a separate area from the older kids, so there is no concern about having to compete with them. All the eggs are placed in plain sight&#8212;not really hidden at all. For these preschoolers, though, just navigating the space, spotting the eggs, and picking them up are plenty of challenge. There are plenty of eggs and no pushy big kids to spoil the fun.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span id="p452" aria-label=" page 452. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><b>Level 2&#8212;ages 6&#8211;9 (players)</b>: These kids enjoy a standard egg hunt over a large area, with eggs hidden in places that are sometimes tricky. There are enough eggs for everyone, but kids still need to move fast and look carefully.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Level 3&#8212;ages 10&#8211;13 (elders)</b>: These older children are given the task of hiding the eggs. They are very proud of this job&#8212;they find it challenging and fun, feel honored with the responsibility, and enjoy the status it gives them, compared to the younger kids. They also often enjoy giving hints to the kids who are having trouble.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec25_2_7"><span class="pd_orange">Community Tip #7: Force Players to Depend on Each Other</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Conflict alone cannot create community. The conflict situation must be one where getting aid from other players will help resolve the conflict. Most videogame designers have been conditioned to create games that are playable by a single player alone, even in a multiplayer game. The logic is something like &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to exclude players who would prefer to play alone.&#8221; And this is a valid concern. But when you create a game that can be mastered when playing solo, you diminish the value of community. If, on the other hand, you create situations where players must communicate and interact to succeed, you give community real value. This often involves the counterintuitive step of taking something away from the players. The mobile game <i>Spaceteam</i> exemplifies this&#8212;each player has information vital to the mission that only others can act on&#8212;which guarantees constant communication. In <i>Toontown Online</i>, our team decided on an unusual rule: players cannot heal themselves during a battle&#8212;they can only heal other players. There was a great deal of concern that some players would find the rule frustrating, but after we implemented it, this did not seem to be the case. Instead, it achieved its objectives well. It forced people to communicate (&#8220;I need a Toon-up!&#8221;) and encouraged them to help each other. Remember <a href="C21_chapter18.xhtml#box80">Lens #80</a>: <i><a href="C21_chapter18.xhtml#box80">Help</a></i>? People want to help each other&#8212;helping another person is a deeply satisfying feeling, even when it is just helping them win a videogame. But we are often shy about helping others, for fear we might insult them with our offer of help. But if you can create situations where players need each other&#8217;s help and can easily ask for it, others will quickly come to their aid, and your community will be the stronger for it.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec25_2_8"><span class="pd_orange">Community Tip #8: Manage Your Community</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">If you believe that community is important to your game experience, you need to do more than just cross your fingers and hope it will happen. Now that games can be updated based on player feedback on an ongoing basis, players expect it. You need to create appropriate tools and systems to let your players communicate and organize, and you may need to have professional community managers who build and maintain a strong feedback loop between designers and players. Think of these managers like gardeners. They don&#8217;t create the communities directly, but they plant <span id="p453" aria-label=" page 453. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the seeds for them and encourage them to grow by observing and catering to their specific needs. This is a role of nurturing, listening, and encouraging. Amy Jo Kim&#8217;s aforementioned book, <i>Community Building on the Web</i>, has some excellent advice about how to carefully manage online communities by striking the right balance between a &#8220;hands-on&#8221; and &#8220;hands-off&#8221; approach.</p>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec25_2_9"><span class="pd_orange">Community Tip #9: Obligation to Others Is Powerful</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">In parts of aboriginal Australia, it is considered rude to give a gift unexpectedly, because doing so creates a burden to give a return gift. This may be a cultural extreme, but obligation to others is something deeply felt in all cultures. If you can create situations where players can make promises to each other (&#8220;Let&#8217;s meet up at 10 p.m. Wednesday to fight some trolls&#8221;) or owe each other favors (&#8220;That healing spell saved my life! I owe you one!&#8221;), players will take them seriously. Many <i>World of Warcraft</i> players report that obligation to their guild is one of the strongest forces in getting them to play on a regular basis. This is partly because they want to enjoy high status in the guild, but often there is another reason&#8212;avoiding low status. Gifting was responsible for a huge part of the massively viral spread of Facebook games. As we&#8217;ve seen with <a href="C14_chapter11.xhtml#box25">Lens #25</a>: <i><a href="C14_chapter11.xhtml#box25">Judgment</a></i>, no one wants to be negatively judged by other players, and failing to live up to commitments is one of the quickest ways to make people think less of you. Carefully designed systems of player-to-player commitment are an excellent way to get players to play your game on a regular basis and to help build strong community.</p>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec25_2_10"><span class="pd_orange">Community Tip #10: Create Community Events</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Almost all successful communities are anchored by regular events. In the real world, these can be meetings, parties, competitions, practice sessions, or awards ceremonies. And in the virtual world, it&#8217;s pretty much the same. Events serve many purposes for a community:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">They give players something to look forward to.</p></li>
<li><p class="list">They create a shared experience, which makes players feel more connected to their community.</p></li>
<li><p class="list">They punctuate time, giving players something to remember.</p></li>
<li><p class="list">They are a guarantee of an opportunity to connect with others.</p></li>
<li><p class="list">The knowledge that events are frequent makes players want to keep checking back to find out about which events are coming up.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Players will often create their own events, but why not create some of your own? With an online game, it can be as simple as creating a simple goal for players and sending a mass email.</p>

<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">What conflict is at the heart of my community?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">How does architecture shape my community?</p></li>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec25_3"><span id="p454" aria-label=" page 454. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="pd_orange">The Challenge of Griefing</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Griefing is one issue that any community-based game, particularly an online game, has to deal with eventually. For some players, the game itself isn&#8217;t as enjoyable as teasing, tricking, and torturing the other players. If you remember Bartle&#8217;s four-player types matched to hearts, spades, diamonds, and clubs (<a class="nounder" href="C12_chapter9.xhtml#chapter9">Chapter 9</a>: <a class="nounder" href="C12_chapter9.xhtml#chapter9"><i>Player</i></a>), the griefer would be the Joker.</p>
<p class="indent">Recalling <a href="C23_chapter20.xhtml#box90">Lens #90</a>: <i><a href="C23_chapter20.xhtml#box90">Status</a></i>, the griefer sees himself as higher status than the other players because of the power he can wield over them by spoiling a game that they care about and he doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="indent">What can a game designer do about griefing? Some games have created &#8220;antigriefing policies&#8221; that ban griefers from the game&#8212;this is one way to handle the problem, but it creates the ugly situation of having to police griefing and then having to maintain a &#8220;court of law&#8221; to decide which griefing was intentional abuse and which was just &#8220;fooling around.&#8221; A better idea is to avoid game systems that make griefing easy. These are the systems that are easiest for griefers to exploit:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list-item"><b>Player vs. player combat</b>: Some games, such as first-person shooters, make player vs. player (PvP) combat the heart of the game. But if you are making a game where PvP combat is not the core activity, you should think carefully about why you are supporting it. While it can be exciting, it can also make players feel constantly threatened and never safe. A typical griefer trick in a game with no limits <span id="p455" aria-label=" page 455. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>on PvP is to befriend a player, spending just enough time with them to build up some trust and then unexpectedly kill the player and steal their inventory. You could argue that this is &#8220;just part of the game,&#8221; but generally the griefers aren&#8217;t doing it for advantage in the game&#8212;they are doing it just for the enjoyment of torturing another human being. Ultimately, this creates an environment where players are afraid to talk to strangers&#8212;and what kind of community does that leave you with? If you really feel that PvP combat is an important part of your game, you should consider ways to confine it to special areas or circumstances, which makes it difficult to use it as a griefing opportunity.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item"><b>Stealing</b>: In many games, items give players a great deal of power. Any opportunity to rob others of this power is very attractive to griefers. This could be through pickpocketing or by &#8220;looting&#8221; a player after battling them. Being stolen from really makes a player feel violated, and as a result, griefers love doing it. Unless you are planning to make a game that is fun for griefers and frustrating for everyone else, you probably don&#8217;t want to support features that let players steal from each other. Of course, there are other kinds of stealing than just stealing items. Some games have a problem with &#8220;kill stealing.&#8221; In the initial version of <i>EverQuest</i>, for example, only the player who dealt the final blow against an enemy would get any experience points for it. Griefers would make a habit of standing nearby a battle, waiting for a powerful monster to be nearly defeated, and then sneak in a killing blow, &#8220;stealing&#8221; all the experience. Again, few players did this as a valid strategy, but many did it for the joy of griefing. Creating systems that make it difficult for players to seize things that are not rightfully theirs is one way to make griefing difficult.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item"><b>Trading</b>: If you give players the opportunity to trade items, you set up the possibility of unfair trades. If players have total information about the items they will receive, it is difficult to use the system for griefing. But if there is any way to misrepresent items that you are trying to trade, griefers will pounce and use it as an opportunity to make unfair trades.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item"><b>Obscenities</b>: One thing griefers enjoy is using shocking and disturbing language in front of other players. If you set up filters for this kind of language, it will become a game for griefers to find ways around your filtering system, and they almost always can, if you are using a &#8220;black list&#8221; (certain words are forbidden) or &#8220;white list&#8221; (only certain words are allowed), or any other kind of automated chat filter, because the human mind is so much better at detecting patterns than any machine. The most successful systems for stopping this kind of griefing are the ones that use an automated filter combined with a system that lets players report rude behavior. Voice chat makes this a much harder problem, but with the rise of voice recognition, it&#8217;s starting to happen. Amusingly, NBA 2K14 on Xbox One gave &#8220;technical fouls&#8221; when the microphone picks up spoken foul language. Another good technique to limit obscene griefing comes from using <a href="C18_chapter15.xhtml#box63">Lens #63</a>: <i><a href="C18_chapter15.xhtml#box63">Feedback</a></i>. Keeping in mind that obscenities are a game to the griefer, you can take the fun out of the game by giving them no feedback about whether the <span id="p456" aria-label=" page 456. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>obscenity filter worked or not. Simply let them see the obscenity on their side, and filter the message appropriately to the other players. They can still find ways to beat this system, but it is much more work and much less fun.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item"><b>Blocking the way</b>: One of the simplest and most annoying griefing moves is to bar the way so that players can&#8217;t get where they are trying to go. Solutions to this problem range from making sure the collision system lets players slip past each other, to creating doorways wide enough that they cannot be blocked by a single player, to allowing players to push other players out of the way. In <i>Toontown Online</i>, we chose this last solution. But, even then, the griefers took advantage! Since players could push each other around, it became a popular prank to find an &#8220;abandoned avatar,&#8221; whose player had stepped away from the keyboard and push them slowly down the street and into a battle!</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item"><b>Loopholes</b>: Possibly the griefer&#8217;s greatest joy is to find a loophole in a game system that lets them do something that they shouldn&#8217;t be able to do. If griefers can disconnect during a battle to deny another player a valuable treasure, they will do it. If they can occasionally crash the server by jumping up and down in a corner for two hours, they will do it. If they can arrange furniture in a public place to spell obscene words, they will do it. And definitely if they find a way to steal resources, they will do it. Anything they can do to vandalize or annoy will make them feel powerful and important, particularly if other players don&#8217;t know how to do it. You must be ever mindful of these loopholes and careful to remove them whenever they turn up. Dealing with problems like this is part of why making online multiplayer games is such an arduous process.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Game communities have been an important part of life on earth for centuries, mostly via sports teams, both professional and amateur. As we transition into the age of the Internet and social media, new kinds of game communities are becoming-important as well. In this new age, a person&#8217;s online identity becomes something important and intensely personal. Choosing an online handle and identity has become an important rite of passage for children and young teenagers. Most people who create these identities will retain them their entire lives. Most people who created a handle twenty years ago still use the same one today and have no intention of changing it. Combine this with the fact that the most expressive online experience one can have is through multiplayer game worlds and one can easily imagine a future where players will create avatars for games as young children that become part of their personal and professional lives as they grow older. Just as people today often have lifelong allegiance to a particular sports team, perhaps the guilds players join as children will influence their personal social networks for the rest of their lives. And what will happen to these online identities and social networks when players die? Perhaps they will be memorialized in some kind of online mausoleum, or perhaps our avatars will outlive us and be passed on to children and grandchildren, giving our future descendants a strange connection to their ancestors. It is an exciting time to be creating online games, for the new kinds of communities we invent may become permanent elements of human culture for centuries to come.</p>
