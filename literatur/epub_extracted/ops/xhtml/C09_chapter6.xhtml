<h2 class="h3" id="sec6_1"><span class="pd_orange">Mere Games</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Great themes and deep meanings are often associated with literature or with great works of art. Is it pretentious for a &#8220;mere game&#8221; to aspire to the same levels of greatness?</p>
<p class="indent">As game designers, we must confront the painful truth that many people view games, in all their forms, as meaningless diversions. Usually, when I press people who hold this view, I can get them to admit some game that is very important to them. Sometimes it is a sport, either one they have played or one they watch religiously. Sometimes it is a card or board game that formed the cornerstone of their relationship with someone important to them. Sometimes it is a videogame with a storyline and characters that they identify with. When I point out the hypocrisy of games as meaningless, but a game as meaningful, they explain, &#8220;Well, it really wasn&#8217;t the game I cared about&#8212;it was the experience that went with the game.&#8221; But as we&#8217;ve discussed, experiences aren&#8217;t just associated with games at random; they are what emerge when players interact with a game. The parts of the experience that are important to people, such as the drama of a sporting event, the camaraderie between bridge players, or the rivalry of chess enthusiasts, all are determined by the design of the game.</p>
<p class="indent">Some people make the argument that games, especially videogames, cannot be deep and meaningful because they are simply too primitive in nature. The same argument was made about film at the beginning of the twentieth century when it was silent and black and white. As technology increased, this argument faded away. And the same is happening for games. In the 1970s, videogames were so simplified as to be almost completely abstract. Today, they can include text, pictures, video, sound, and music. As technology advances, more and more aspects of human life and expression will be integrated into games. There is nothing that cannot be part of a game. You can put a painting, a radio broadcast, or a movie into a game, but you cannot put a game into these other things. All these other types of media, and all media that is to come, are subsets of games. At their technological limit, games will subsume all other media.</p>
<p class="indent">Really, the problem is that games have only recently emerged as anything like a serious medium of expression. It will take time for the world to grow used to this idea. But we have no reason to wait. We can create games with powerful themes right now. But why? Why do this? Out of a selfish need for artistic expression? No. Because we are designers. Artistic expression is not our goal. Our goal is to create powerful experiences. It is possible to create games that do not have themes or that have very weak themes. However, if our games have unifying, resonant themes, the experiences we create will be much, much stronger.</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec6_2"><span id="p63" aria-label=" page 63. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="pd_orange">Unifying Themes</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The primary benefit of basing your design around a single theme is that all of the elements of your game will reinforce one another, since they will all be working toward a common goal. Sometimes it is best to let a theme emerge as you are creating the game. The sooner you have settled on a theme, the easier things will be for you, because you will have an easy method of deciding if something belongs in your game or not: If it reinforces the theme, it stays, but if it doesn&#8217;t, it goes.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two simple steps to using a theme to strengthen the power of your game&#8217;s experience:</p>
<ul class="list-simple1">
<li><p class="list-item"><b>Step 1</b>: Figure out what your theme is.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item"><b>Step 2</b>: Use every means possible to reinforce that theme.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Sounds easy, but what is a theme? The theme is what your game is about. It is the idea that ties your entire game together&#8212;the idea that all the elements must support. If you don&#8217;t know what your theme is, it is very likely that your game is not engaging people as much as it could. Most game themes are experience based; that is, the goal of the design is to deliver an essential experience to the player.</p>
<p class="indent">Designer Rich Gold describes an elementary example of theming in his book <i>The Plenitude</i>. As a child, he had a book about elephants. The idea of the book was simple: to deliver an experience to children that lets them understand what elephants were. In a sense, you could say the theme was &#8220;What are elephants?&#8221; So, step 1 is done. This brings us to step 2: use every means possible to reinforce that theme. The authors did the obvious&#8212;the book contained text about elephants and pictures of elephants. But they took it a step further and cut the entire book, cover and pages, into the shape of an elephant, as well. At every turn, you need to look for opportunities to reinforce your theme in clever and unexpected ways.</p>
<p class="indent">Let me give a more detailed example based on a virtual reality game I worked on for Disney called <i>Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Buccaneer Gold</i>. Our team (the Disney VR Studio) was given the assignment of creating an interactive adaptation of the popular Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride, which can be seen in various incarnations at all the Disney parks. We knew we were going to put it in a Computer Augmented Virtual Environment (CAVE), which is basically a small room with 3D projections on the walls at DisneyQuest (Disney&#8217;s virtual reality center at Disney World), and the experience had to be about five minutes long, but no storyline or specific game goals had been set.</p>
<p class="indent">We already had the beginnings of a theme: this attraction was going to be about pirates, which narrowed things down, but we were hoping to be more specific. <span id="p64" aria-label=" page 64. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>What point of view did we want to take about pirates? There are several we could have taken:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">A historical documentary about pirates.</p></li>
<li><p class="list">A battle between competing pirate ships.</p></li>
<li><p class="list">A search for hidden pirate treasure.</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Pirates are villains and must be destroyed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Several others came to mind as well. You can see that even with something as narrow as &#8220;pirates,&#8221; we still didn&#8217;t really have a theme, because there are many possible experiences around the idea of pirates that we could create. We started doing research, looking for game ideas, aesthetic ideas, and hopefully a clear, unifying theme.</p>
<p class="indent">We read a lot about the history of pirates, and we looked at pirate-themed video games other people had made. We talked to people who had been involved in the creation of the original Pirates of the Caribbean ride. We got lots of good details but were not getting much closer to a theme. One day, we all piled into a car and headed down to Disneyland to study the ride up close. We rode the ride dozens of times before park hours frantically scribbling notes and snapping pictures. There is a huge amount of detail in the ride&#8212;it is incredibly compelling. We could see that details were going to be very important. But what about the story? Weirdly, the <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> ride doesn&#8217;t tell a coherent story. It just features several immersive tableaus of pirates doing pirate things. In a sense, this is a real strength: the story is left to the rider&#8217;s imagination.</p>
<p class="indent">So, we learned some good things from riding, but we still didn&#8217;t have a theme. We interviewed park employees, and when the park opened, we chatted with guests about their feelings about the ride. We got lots of great details about how the ride looks, how it makes people feel, and what their favorite parts were, but none of it really clued us into a solid point of view for our theme.</p>
<p class="indent">On the way home in the car, as we talked over the thousands of details we had observed, we fretted a little that we still didn&#8217;t have a clear path forward. As we sat and thought, it was almost impossible not to hum the catchy theme song from the ride, having heard it so many times&#8230; &#8220;Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate&#8217;s life for me.&#8221; And suddenly it became clear! The <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> ride is not about pirates; it is about being a pirate! The whole goal of the ride is to fulfill the fantasy of what it is like to throw aside the rules of society and just start being a pirate! It might sound obvious in retrospect, but this shift in our thinking crystallized everything. This was not a historical recreation, and it was not about destroying pirates. It was about fulfilling the pirate fantasy that everyone has bubbling just below the surface, and what better way to create this feeling of being a pirate than through an immersive, interactive experience? We now had our experience-based theme: the fantasy of being a pirate.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="p65" aria-label=" page 65. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>And so step one was completed. We knew our theme. Now for step two, use every means possible to reinforce that theme. And we really did work hard to use everything we could to do just that. Some examples include the following:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list"><b>CAVE shape</b>: In the past, we had used square and hexagonal CAVES. We created a new, four-screen CAVE shape that was better suited to a pirate ship simulation.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Stereoptics</b>: Not every CAVE experience uses stereoptics, but we chose to do so, because of the sense of depth they give. Letting your eyes focus on infinity really helped make it feel like you were out at sea.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Modified 3D glasses</b>: Many off-the-shelf 3D glasses for theaters have blinders on the side to reduce distractions when watching a movie. We knew that a person&#8217;s sense of motion is strongly influenced by their peripheral vision, so these blinders were a problem&#8212;they were detracting from our theme, since players weren&#8217;t getting enough of a sense of sailing at sea. We made arrangements with the manufacturer to have the blinders cut off.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Motion platform</b>: We wanted to give the feeling of a rocking, swaying boat. A motion platform seemed like a good idea, but what kind? Eventually, we custom-built a platform using pneumatics, because it felt the most like a ship at sea.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Interface</b>: Part of the pirate fantasy is steering a ship, and part of it is firing cannons. We could have used joysticks or other off-the-shelf hardware, but that wouldn&#8217;t be very good theming. Instead, the ship is steered with a ship&#8217;s wheel, and we had real metal cannons that players would use to aim and fire.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Visuals</b>: We had to make things look beautiful. The ride features a kind of &#8220;hyperreal&#8221; look, which fits perfectly with our theme. We used high-end graphics hardware and rich textures and models to achieve a similar look.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Music</b>: Through some pains, we got permission to use the music from the ride. It captures the theme so well and connects the game to the ride, in a powerful nostalgic way.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Audio</b>: Our sound designers created a custom ten-speaker sound system that could play sounds from all directions, making you feel like you were out at sea. Some of the speakers were designed only to play cannon blasts and were placed at precisely the right distance from the boat so that the waveform would collapse in your stomach, so you would not just hear but feel the cannons firing.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>A feeling of freedom</b>: Piracy is all about freedom. Our gameplay mechanics were designed to let players sail wherever they chose but at the same time ensure the players have an exciting time. Details of how this was accomplished will be discussed in detail in <a class="nounder" href="C21_chapter18.xhtml#chapter18">Chapter 18</a>: <a class="nounder" href="C21_chapter18.xhtml#chapter18"><i>Indirect Control</i></a>.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Dead men tell no tales</b>: How to handle death in the game was a real question. Some advocated that this was a videogame, and we should handle it like video-games traditionally do: if you die, there is some penalty, and then you come back to life, to play again. This didn&#8217;t fit in well with our theme of living the pirate <span id="p66" aria-label=" page 66. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>fantasy&#8212;in the fantasy, you don&#8217;t die, or if you do, it is in an incredibly dramatic way, and you do not return. Further, we were trying very hard to maintain a dramatic interest curve (explained in <a class="nounder" href="C19_chapter16.xhtml#chapter16">Chapter 16</a>) for our five-minute experience, since drama is part of the pirate fantasy. If the players could suddenly die in the middle of the game, it would spoil that. Our solution was to make players invulnerable throughout the majority of the game, but if they took too many hits over the course of the experience, their ship would sink dramatically at the end of the final battle. This broke with videogame tradition, but theme is more important than tradition.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Treasure</b>: Collecting vast hordes of treasure is an essential part of the pirate fantasy. Unfortunately, piles of gold are actually pretty hard to render convincingly in a videogame. We came up with a special technique that made flat, hand-painted treasures seem to be solid, dimensional objects that sat prominently on the ship&#8217;s deck.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Lighting</b>: We needed to light the room the players stood in. How could we theme that? We used special filters on the light that made it look like it was light reflected off of water.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>A place for my stuff</b>: People who step up to the controls need a place to put their bags, purses, etc. We could have just made a shelf. Instead, we created bags out of fishing nets that really look like they belong on a boat.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Air conditioning</b>: The people in charge of facilities in the building where the game was going to go asked if we cared where the air conditioning vents in the room were placed. Our first thought was &#8220;who cares?&#8221; But then we thought, &#8220;How can we use this to reinforce our theme?&#8221; The vents were placed at the front of the ship, blowing back, so players feel a breeze as they sail their ship.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>The eyes of Bluebeard</b>: One thing we never figured out how to theme was the 3D glasses. We experimented with making them look like pirate hats and bandanas, but it didn&#8217;t really work. One witty gentleman suggested that players should be forced to wear eye patches, so the 3D effect was unnecessary. In the end, we gave up and let that detail go unthemed. To our surprise, when the game had been installed at Disney World and we went to try it out, the cast member who was about to lead us on board proclaimed, &#8220;Before ye board, ye must wear the Eyes of Bluebeard.&#8221; This was surprising, because it was not in the &#8220;official script&#8221; given to cast members. The ride attendants succeeded where we had failed. It was a simple and effective way to theme a detail that escaped us and a powerful illustration that when you have a strong unifying theme, it makes it easier for everyone on the team to make useful contributions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">This is not a complete list. Everything we did and every decision we made were focused on whether it would reinforce the theme and deliver the essential experience we wanted to get across. You might argue that without a big budget, you can&#8217;t afford to do fancy theming. But many theming details are really quite inexpensive. <span id="p67" aria-label=" page 67. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>They can be a line of text, or a color choice, or a sound effect. And theming is fun&#8212;once you get in the habit of trying to make as many things as possible fit your theme, it&#8217;s hard to stop. But why would you stop? And this gives us <a href="C09_chapter6.xhtml#box11">Lens #11</a>.</p>

<section class="level3">
<h2 class="h3" id="sec6_3"><span class="pd_orange">Resonance</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">A unifying theme is good&#8212;it focuses your design toward a single goal. But some themes are better than others. The best themes are ones that resonate with players&#8212;themes that touch players deeply. The &#8220;fantasy of being a pirate&#8221; theme is powerful because it is a fantasy that everyone&#8212;kids, adults, men, and women&#8212;has had at one time or another. In a sense, it resonates with our desire to be free&#8212;free from our obligations, free from our worries and cares, free to do what we want, when we want to.</p>
<p class="indent">When you manage to tap into one of these resonant themes, you have something deep and powerful that has a true ability to move people and to give them an experience that is both transcendent and transforming. Earlier we discussed that some themes are experience based, that is, they are all about delivering a certain essential experience. When this experience is one that resonates with the fantasies and desires of your players, it will be an experience that quickly becomes important to them. But there is another kind of theme that can be just as resonant as an experience-based theme, sometimes more so. This is the truth-based theme.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="p68" aria-label=" page 68. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Consider the movie <i>Titanic</i>. This film deeply moved audiences the world over. Why? Sure, it was well executed, and it had great special effects and a sweet (though sometimes schmaltzy) love story, but lots of movies have those things. What was special here was a deep and resonant theme reinforced by every element of the film. So, what was the theme? At first, you might say that the theme was the Titanic itself and its tragic accident. And that is an important component of the movie. In fact, you could argue that it is a theme of the movie, but it is not the main theme. The main theme is not experience based. Instead, it is a simple statement, which I would phrase as something like &#8220;love is more important than life and stronger than death.&#8221; This is a powerful statement. But it is a statement that many of us believe deeply in our heart of hearts. It is certainly not a scientific truth, but for many, it is a deeply held, though rarely expressed, personal truth.</p>
<p class="indent">Many Hollywood insiders did not believe this movie could possibly be successful: audiences would know the ending. But where better to tell a story that fits this powerful theme than in a place where we know almost everyone is going to die? The expensive special effects were not gratuitous&#8212;to fully grasp the import of this theme, we must feel like it is all real, like we are right there, like we are dying ourselves.</p>
<p class="indent">Truth-based themes can sometimes be hard to spot. Part of the power of these deep truths is that they are hidden. Often, a designer might not even consciously know they have chosen a particular theme or be able to express it verbally&#8212;they just have a certain feeling about how the experience should be. But it is worth the trouble to explore your feelings about these things to the point that you can express your theme concretely. It will make it much easier for you to decide what should and shouldn&#8217;t go into your game and make it easier for you to explain the rationale of these decisions to others in your team. When Stephen King was writing his famous novel <i>Carrie</i>, it was not until he was working on the second draft that he realized that this was a novel about blood, not just horror movie blood, but an exploration of the many meanings of blood, from injury, to family ties, to coming of age. And realizing this, he saw many opportunities to tune and strengthen the story.</p>
<p class="indent">An excellent example of a truth-based theme can be seen in Rob Daviau&#8217;s fascinating board game <i>Risk: Legacy</i>. In this unusual game, Daviau did something never before attempted in the world of board games&#8212;he created game mechanics such that when you play, choices you make change the game permanently, for all time. The rules insist you modify the board with irremovable stickers, write on the board in permanent marker to claim territories, rip up and discard game cards, and even make permanent modifications to the game rulebook. These unusual game mechanics are novel and intriguing, but more importantly, they reinforce the game&#8217;s central theme: &#8220;war changes a world.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Another example of a truth-based theme is the Hercules story. The VR Studio team was asked to create a game based upon Disney&#8217;s version of the ancient Hercules myth. When a story stays alive, told, and retold, for thousands of years like this story has, it is a pretty good clue that there is a truth-based theme hiding inside it. Sure, Hercules was a strong man, but that doesn&#8217;t seem quite important enough that it would so deeply resonate with people. We looked at the various versions of <span id="p69" aria-label=" page 69. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the story. Interestingly, there was not one canonical telling, even in ancient times. Sometimes Hercules had ten labors, sometimes twelve, and sometimes twenty. But there were certain aspects of the story that were always the same. In every story, Hercules is a man so virtuous that he defeats death. And this is a truth so deep that it is at the heart of many religions: if you are virtuous enough, you can defeat death. The Disney animators embodied this theme in Hercules&#8217; conflict with Hades, Lord of the Underworld. We continued this theme in our game, by having it take place mostly in the Underworld, until the end, when you triumphantly break through to the world of the living for a final aerial battle against Hades. There were subthemes too, such as a theme about the importance of teamwork, but ultimately, we placed these subthemes in the service of the main theme.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes you figure out your theme a piece at a time. Here&#8217;s another Disney story: when we started work on the <i>Toontown Online</i> project (Disney&#8217;s first massively multiplayer game), we were again unsure of our theme. We had done our homework on <i>Toontown</i>, studying both the <i>Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</i> movie and the <i>Toontown</i> section of Disneyland. Curiously, <i>Toontown</i> was not well defined in either place. We could see <i>Toontown</i> was powerful, though. The reason it was so ill defined was that everyone seemed to already have a sense of what it was&#8212;as if they had known all along that there was a special place where cartoon characters lived when they weren&#8217;t on the screen. This (slightly creepy) fact gave us a sense we were tapping into something fundamental and hidden. We started making lists of things we thought <i>Toontown</i> seemed to be about. Three big ones stood out:</p>
<ol class="list-order">
<li><p class="list">Having fun with your friends</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Escaping from reality</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Simplicity and transcendence</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">The first one lent itself really well to online networked play, and we liked that. The second one made a lot of sense&#8212;cartoons are a good form of escapism. The third one (which we&#8217;ll be exploring in more detail in <a class="nounder" href="C22_chapter19.xhtml#chapter19">Chapter 19</a>: <a class="nounder" href="C22_chapter19.xhtml#chapter19"><i>Worlds</i></a>) is basically the idea that things are simpler in <i>Toontown</i> than they are in the real world, but you are also more powerful in <i>Toontown</i> than you are in the real world.</p>
<p class="indent">All of this helped clarify what we wanted to see in the game, but none of it really established a clear theme. These felt more like subthemes. At some point, we realized that these three things together strongly characterize something that back in <a class="nounder" href="C07_chapter4.xhtml#chapter4">Chapter 4</a> we discussed in detail: play. Play is about having fun with your friends and escaping from reality, and a play world is simpler than the real world, but you have much more power. But we didn&#8217;t feel like play was a powerful theme on its own. We needed something with more bite, with more conflict. This led us to play&#8217;s natural opponent: work. And then it was clear&#8212;&#8220;work vs. play&#8221; would be a very strong theme. Stated in more detail, &#8220;work wants to destroy play, but play must survive&#8221; was the truth-based theme we arrived at. Replace &#8220;work&#8221; and &#8220;play&#8221; with &#8220;slavery&#8221; and &#8220;freedom&#8221; as we did in <a class="nounder" href="C07_chapter4.xhtml#chapter4">Chapter 4</a>, and the power of this theme <span id="p70" aria-label=" page 70. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>becomes clear. It really felt right. We wanted to create a game that kids and parents could play together, with a theme they could both relate to&#8212;how better to do that than by playfully exploring one of the primary conflicts in their lives? And so we did. The story of <i>Toontown Online</i> became a story of robot executives (the Cogs) trying to turn colorful <i>Toontown</i> into a dingy office park. The Toons team up to fight off the Cogs with gags and practical jokes, and the Cogs fight back with office supplies. This story was strange enough that it raised some eyebrows inside the company, but we were confident it would work because it was an expression of a theme that we knew would resonate with our audience.</p>
<p class="indent">Resonant themes elevate your work from craft to art. An artist is someone who takes you where you could never go alone, and a theme is the vehicle for getting there. Not every theme needs to be a resonant theme, of course. But when you find a deep resonant theme, it makes sense to use it for all it is worth. Some will be experience based, while others will be truth based. You can never tell which themes are resonant just through logic&#8212;you have to feel the resonance, deep inside yourself. It is an important form of self-listening and is also <a href="C09_chapter6.xhtml#box12">Lens #12</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent">The Lens of Resonance is a quiet, delicate instrument. It is a tool for listening to yourself and listening to others. We bury important things deep inside ourselves, and when something causes them to resonate, it shakes us to our very core. The fact that these things are hidden gives them power but also makes them hard for us to find.</p>

<p class="noindent">You may think that all this talk of resonant themes is too lofty for game design. And for some games, maybe it is. Does <i>Angry Birds</i> have a deep resonant theme? Maybe not, but it certainly does have a unifying theme that helped to drive the design. Resonant themes can add great power to your work, but even if your game doesn&#8217;t seem to have one, it will still be strengthened by a unifying theme to focus the experience.</p>
<p class="indent">Some designers reject the notion of theme, because they say, &#8220;the players will never notice.&#8221; And it is certainly true that the players cannot always state clearly the theme of a work that truly moves them&#8212;and that is because theme often operates at a subconscious level. Players know they like a game, but they can&#8217;t quite say why. Often, the reason is that all of the elements are reinforcing a theme that is interesting or important to them. Theme is not about some puzzle-based symbolism where the designer intends a secret message. Theme is about focusing your work toward something that holds meaning for your players.</p>
<p class="indent">Different designers use theme in different ways as part of their design process. Now it is time for us to explore the many other aspects of the overall process of game design.</p>
