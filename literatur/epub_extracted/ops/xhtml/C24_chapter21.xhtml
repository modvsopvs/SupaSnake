Yes and no. We discussed the idea of functional space&#8212;but functional space is only the skeleton of the game space. In this chapter, we will examine the fleshed-out space the player actually experiences.</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec21_1"><span class="pd_orange">The Purpose of Architecture</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="quote"><i>Yes, build a Frank Lloyd house if you don&#8217;t mind camping in the front yard when it rains.</i></p>
<p class="right">&#8212;Aline Barnsdall</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">What do you think of when you hear the word &#8220;architecture&#8221;? Most people think of grand buildings, particularly modern buildings with unusual shapes. People sometimes seem to think that the primary job of the architect is to sculpt the outer shape of a building, and that appreciation of good architecture means enjoying these building shapes like one might enjoy sculptures in a museum.</p>
<p class="indent">And while the outer shape of a structure is one aspect of architecture, it has little to do with the primary purpose of architecture.</p>
<p class="indent">The primary purpose of architecture is to control a person&#8217;s experience.</p>
<p class="indent">If all the experiences we wanted to have were to be found easily in nature, there would be no point to architecture. But those experiences aren&#8217;t always there, so architects design things to help us have the experiences we desire. We want to experience shade and dryness, so we put up shelters. We want to experience safety and security, so we build walls. We build houses, schools, malls, churches, offices, bowling alleys, hotels, and museums not because we want to look at those buildings, but because there are experiences we want to have that these buildings make possible. And when we say one of these buildings is &#8220;well designed,&#8221; we aren&#8217;t talking about what it looks like on the outside. What we are talking about is how well it creates the kind of experience we want to have when we are inside.</p>
<p class="indent">For this reason, architects and game designers are close cousins. Both create structures that people must enter in order to use. Neither architects nor game designers can create experiences directly&#8212;instead, both must rely on the use of indirect control to guide people into having the right kind of experience. And most importantly, both create structures that have no point other than to engender experiences that make people happy.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3">
<h2 class="h3" id="sec21_2"><span class="pd_orange">Organizing Your Game Space</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">There is a more obvious connection between game designers and architects as well&#8212;both have to create spaces. And while game designers can learn a lot about <span id="p397" aria-label=" page 397. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>creating meaningful and powerful spaces from architects, by no means do game designers have to follow every rule of architecture, since the spaces they create are not made of bricks and mortar, but are completely virtual structures. And while this sounds like a wonderful freedom (it is), it can also be a burden. The lack of physical constraints means almost anything is possible&#8212;and if anything is possible, where do you begin?</p>
<p class="indent">One way to begin is to decide on an organizing principle for your game space. If you already have a pretty good idea how your game will be played, this should be pretty easy. Just look at your game through <a href="C15_chapter12.xhtml#box26">Lens #26</a>: <i><a href="C15_chapter12.xhtml#box26">Functional Space</a></i> (from <a class="nounder" href="C15_chapter12.xhtml#chapter12">Chapter 12</a>: <a class="nounder" href="C15_chapter12.xhtml#chapter12"><i>Mechanics</i></a>), and use that as the skeleton for the space you will build.</p>
<p class="indent">But maybe you are still figuring out your functional space&#8212;perhaps your game design is still very early, and you are hoping that by creating a map, you might get a better sense of how your game works. In that case, here are five common ways that designers organize their game spaces.</p>
<ol class="list-order">
<li><p class="list"><b>Linear</b>: A surprising number of games are arranged on a linear game space where a player can only move forward and (maybe) back along a line. Sometimes the line has two ends; other times, it loops back on itself. Some well-known linear game spaces are as follows:</p>
<ol class="list-alpha-lower">
<li><p class="list"><i>Candyland</i></p></li>
<li><p class="list"><i>Monopoly</i></p></li>
<li><p class="list"><i>Super Mario Brothers</i></p></li>
<li><p class="list"><i>Jetpack Joyride</i></p></li>
<li><p class="list"><i>Guitar Hero</i></p></li>
</ol>
<figure class="informalfigure">
<img alt="" src="../images/un21_1.jpg"/>
</figure></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Grid</b>: Arranging your game space on a grid has a lot of advantages. It can be easy for players to understand, it makes it easier to ensure that things line up, it keeps things in proper proportion, and of course, grids are very easy for computers to understand. Your grid need not be a grid of squares&#8212;it can also be of rectangles, hexagons (popular in war games), or even triangles. Some well-known grid-based games are as follows:</p>
<ol class="list-alpha-lower">
<li><p class="list"><i>Chess</i></p></li>
<li><p class="list"><i>Advance Wars</i></p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span id="p398" aria-label=" page 398. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><i>Settlers of Catan</i></p></li>
<li><p class="list"><i>Legend of Zelda (NES)</i></p></li>
<li><p class="list"><i>Minecraft</i></p></li>
</ol>
<figure class="informalfigure">
<img alt="" src="../images/un21_2.jpg"/>
</figure></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Web</b>: A web arrangement is achieved by marking several points on a map and connecting them with paths. This is useful when you have several places you want players to visit but you want to give them a number of different ways to get to them. Sometimes there is meaningful travel along the paths, but other times, travel is instantaneous. Some examples of web-based game spaces are as follows:</p>
<ol class="list-alpha-lower">
<li><p class="list"><i>Fox and Geese</i></p></li>
<li><p class="list"><i>Trivial Pursuit</i></p></li>
<li><p class="list"><i>Zork</i></p></li>
<li><p class="list"><i>Club Penguin</i></p></li>
<li><p class="list"><i>Puzzle Quest</i></p></li>
</ol>
<figure class="informalfigure">
<img alt="" src="../images/un21_3.jpg"/>
</figure></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Points in space</b>: This somewhat uncommon type of game space is usually for games that want to evoke something like wandering a desert and occasionally returning to an oasis, like one does in an RPG. It also is common for games where players get to define the game space themselves. Some examples of this kind of spatial organization are the following:</p>
<ol class="list-alpha-lower">
<li><p class="list"><i>Bocce</i></p></li>
<li><p class="list"><i>Thin Ice</i> (a board game involving wet marbles and a napkin)</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><i>Polarity</i> (magnetic board game)</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span id="p399" aria-label=" page 399. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>
<i>Animal Crossing</i></p></li>
<li><p class="list"><i>Final Fantasy</i></p></li>
</ol>
<figure class="informalfigure">
<img alt="" src="../images/un21_4.jpg"/>
</figure></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Divided space</b>: This kind of space is most like a real map and is common in games that are trying to replicate a real map. It is achieved by carving the space up into sections in an irregular way. Some examples of games that have divided space are as follows:</p>
<ol class="list-alpha-lower">
<li><p class="list"><i>Risk</i></p></li>
<li><p class="list"><i>Axis and Allies</i></p></li>
<li><p class="list"><i>Dark Tower</i></p></li>
<li><p class="list"><i>Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i></p></li>
<li><p class="list"><i>Civilization</i></p></li>
</ol>
<figure class="informalfigure">
<img alt="" src="../images/un21_5.jpg"/>
</figure></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">These different organizing principles are often combined to make interesting new types of game spaces. The game of Clue is a combination of the grid and divided space patterns. Baseball is a combination of a linear structure and points in space.</p>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec21_2_1"><span class="pd_orange">A Word about Landmarks</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">One very important thing to consider whenever you organize a space: What are the landmarks? The very first text adventure game, <i>Colossal Cave</i>, had two different mazes. In one, every area was described as &#8220;You are in a maze of twisty passages, all alike.&#8221; Just as confusing though was the opposite maze, in which every area was described as &#8220;You are in a maze of twisty passages, all different.&#8221; For it is certainly true that too much chaos is just as monotonous as too much order. Players of <i>Colossal Cave</i> learned to drop items in the mazes, forming landmarks that helped them find their way. Any good game space has built-in landmarks, which help the <span id="p400" aria-label=" page 400. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>players find where they are going and also make the space interesting to look at. Landmarks are what players remember and what they talk about, for they are what make a space memorable.</p>

<section class="level3">
<h2 class="h3" id="sec21_3"><span class="pd_orange">Christopher Alexander Is a Genius</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Christopher Alexander is an architect who has devoted his life to studying how places make us feel. His first book, <i>The Timeless Way of Building</i> (1979), tries to describe how there is a unique quality shared by spaces and objects that are truly well designed. As he puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="quote"><i>Imagine yourself on a winter afternoon with a pot of tea, a reading light, and two or three huge pillows to lean back against. Now make yourself comfortable. Not in some way which you can show to other people, and say how much you like it. I mean so that you really like it, for yourself.</i></p>
<p class="quote1"><i>You put the tea where you can reach it: but in a place where you can&#8217;t possibly knock it over. You pull the light down, to shine on the book, but not too brightly, and so that you can&#8217;t see the naked bulb. You put the cushions behind you, and place them, carefully, one by one, just where you want them, to support your back, your neck, your arm: so that you are supported just comfortably, just as you want to sip your tea, and read, and dream.</i></p>
<p class="quote1"><i>When you take the trouble to do all that, and you do it carefully, with much attention, then it may begin to have the quality which has no name.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">It is hard to put a finger on exactly what this quality is, but most people know it when they experience it. Alexander notes that things that have the nameless quality usually have these aspects:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">They feel <b>alive</b>, as if they hold energy.</p></li>
<li><p class="list">They feel <b>whole</b>, like nothing is missing.</p></li>
<li><p class="list">They feel <b>comfortable</b>; it is pleasing to be around them.</p></li>
<li><p class="list">They feel <b>free</b>, not constrained unnaturally.</p></li>
<li><p class="list">They feel <b>exact</b>, as if they are just how they are supposed to be.</p></li>
<li><p class="list">They feel <b>egoless</b>, connected to the universe.</p></li>
<li><p class="list">They feel <b>eternal</b>, as if they have always been and always will be.</p></li>
<li><p class="list">They are <b>free from inner contradictions</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">The last of those, &#8220;free from inner contradictions,&#8221; is tremendously important to any designer, because inner contradictions are at the heart of any bad design. If a device is supposed to make my life easier, and it is hard to use, that is a contradiction. If something is supposed to be fun, and it is boring or frustrating, that is a <span id="p401" aria-label=" page 401. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>contradiction. A good designer must carefully remove inner contradictions, and not get used to them, or make excuses for them&#8212;so let&#8217;s add a tool to our toolbox for removing them.</p>
<aside class="boxed-text" epub:type="tip" role="doc-tip" id="box92">
<h2 class="box-title"><a href="C02b_tol.xhtml#rbox92"><span class="pd_whitez">#92 The Lens of Inner Contradiction</span></a></h2>
<p class="noindent">A good game cannot contain properties that defeat the game&#8217;s very purpose. To remove those contradictory qualities, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">What is the purpose of my game?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">What are the purposes of each subsystem in my game?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Is there anything at all in my game that contradicts these purposes?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">If so, how can I change that?</p></li>
</ul>

</aside>
<p class="indent">Alexander also explains that only through iteration and observation about how something is used can one arrive at a truly excellent design. In other words, the Rule of the Loop holds in architecture as well as game design. A concrete example of this is the system he describes for laying paths between buildings in a complex: &#8220;Lay no paths at all. Merely plant grass. Then come back a year later, see where people have worn paths in the grass, and only then begin to pave.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Alexander&#8217;s next book, <i>A Pattern Language</i>, is his most famous and influential work. In it, he describes 253 different architectural patterns that seem to have the nameless quality. They range from large-scale patterns like &#8220;distribution of towns&#8221; and &#8220;agricultural valleys&#8221; to small-scale patterns such as &#8220;canvas roofs&#8221; and &#8220;windows which open wide.&#8221; The scope and striking detail of <i>A Pattern Language</i> changes the reader&#8217;s viewpoint about how they interact with the everyday world. Many game designers have stories to tell about how the book inspired them. Personally, I was baffled about how to structure the world of <i>Toontown Online</i> until I read this text, and suddenly much of it seemed obvious. Will Wright is said to have designed <i>SimCity</i> based on a desire to experiment with the patterns listed in the book. The entire &#8220;design patterns&#8221; movement in computer science stems from the power of this text as well. What will you create when you read it?</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="p402" aria-label=" page 402. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Alexander was not content to leave the nameless quality nameless. In his later books, he makes a deeper study of what truly gives something that special feeling. He did this by cataloging thousands of different things that did, or did not, have that feeling and then looked for similarities between them. In doing so, he gradually distilled out fifteen fundamental qualities that these things shared, as detailed in <i>The Phenomenon of Life</i>. The book gets its title from an insight he had about the nameless quality: The reason some things seem special to us is that they have some of the same qualities that living things have. As living beings ourselves, we feel connected to things and places that have qualities special to living things.</p>
<p class="indent">Delving into detail about these properties is well beyond the scope of this book, but it can be fascinating and useful to reflect on whether your game contains them. It is excellent mental exercise just to think about how these patterns, which mostly are about spatial and textural qualities, apply to games at all.</p>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec21_3_1"><span class="pd_orange">Alexander&#8217;s Fifteen Properties of Living Structures</span></h3>
<ol class="list-order">
<li><p class="list"><b>Levels of scale</b>: We see levels of scale in &#8220;telescoping goals,&#8221; where a player has to satisfy short-term goals to reach midterm ones and to eventually reach long-term goals. We see it in fractal interest curves. We also see it in nested game world structures. Spore is a symphony of levels of scale.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Strong centers</b>: We see this in visual layout, certainly, but also in our story structure. The avatar is at the center of our game universe&#8212;and generally we prefer strong avatars over weak ones. Also, we prefer strong centers when it comes to our purpose in the game&#8212;our goal.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Boundaries</b>: Many games are primarily about boundaries! Certainly, any game about territory is an exploration of boundaries. But rules are another kind of boundary, and a game with no rules is no game at all.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Alternating repetition</b>: We see this on the pleasing shape of the chessboard, and we see it too in the cycle of level/boss/level/boss that comes up in so many games. Even tense/release/tense/release is an example of pleasing alternating repetition, as seen in <a class="figure" href="C13_chapter10.xhtml#fig10_7">Figure 10.7</a>.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Positive space</b>: What Alexander means here is that the foreground and background elements both have beautiful, complementary shapes, like yin and yang. In a sense, a well-balanced game has this quality&#8212;allowing multiple alternate strategies to have an interlocked beauty.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Good shape</b>: This is as simple as it sounds&#8212;a shape that is pleasing. We certainly look for this in the visual elements of our games. But we can see and feel it, too, in level design. A good level feels &#8220;solid&#8221; and has a &#8220;good curve.&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Local symmetries</b>: This is different from an overall symmetry, like a mirror image; instead, this refers to multiple small, internal symmetries in a design. <span id="p403" aria-label=" page 403. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><i>Zelda: The Wind Waker</i> has this feeling throughout its architecture&#8212;when you are within a room or area, it seems to have a symmetry, but it is connected to other places in a way that feels organic. Rule systems and game balance can have this property as well.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Deep interlock and ambiguity</b>: This is when two things are so tightly intertwined that they define each other&#8212;if you took one away, the other wouldn&#8217;t be itself any longer. We see this in many board games, such as <i>Go</i>. The position of the pieces on the board is only meaningful relative to the opponent&#8217;s pieces.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Contrast</b>: In games, we have many kinds of contrast. The contrast between opponents, between what is controllable and what is not, and between reward and punishment. When opposites in our game are strongly contrasted, the game feels more meaningful and more powerful.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Gradients</b>: This refers to qualities that change gradually. The gradually increasing challenge curve is an example of this, but so are appropriately designed probability curves.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Roughness</b>: When a game is too perfect, it has no character. The handmade feeling of &#8220;house rules&#8221; often makes a game seem more alive.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Echoes</b>: Echoes are a kind of pleasing, unifying repetition. When the boss monster has something in common with his minions, we are experiencing echoes. Good interest curves have this property, especially fractal ones.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>The void</b>: As Alexander says, &#8220;In the most profound centers which have perfect wholeness, there is at the heart a void which is like water, infinite in depth, surrounded by and contrasted with the clutter of the stuff and fabric all around it.&#8221; Think of a church, or the human heart. When boss monsters tend to be in large, hollow spaces, we are experiencing the void.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Simplicity and inner calm</b>: Designers talk endlessly about how important it is for a game to be simple&#8212;usually with a small number of rules that have emergent properties. Of course, these rules must be well balanced, which gives them the inner calm that Alexander describes.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Not-separateness</b>: This refers to something being well connected to its surroundings&#8212;as if it was part of them. Each rule of our game should have this property, but so should every element of our game. If everything in our game has this quality, a certain wholeness results, which makes the game feel very alive indeed. <a href="C09_chapter6.xhtml#box11">Lens #11</a>: <i><a href="C09_chapter6.xhtml#box11">Unification</a></i> can be a good guide to not-separateness.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">Alexander&#8217;s approach to architecture can be quite useful when designing a game space. But as you see, the qualities he describes for a good space apply to many other aspects of game design as well. I have only been able to scratch the surface of Alexander&#8217;s approach to design here. Reading his many delightful books will surely give you new insights into game design. As a reminder of his thoughtful perspective, take this lens.</p>

<h2 class="box-title"><a href="C02b_tol.xhtml#rbox93"><span class="pd_whitez">#93 The Lens of The Nameless Quality</span></a></h2>
<p class="noindent">Certain things feel special and wonderful because of their natural, organic design. To ensure your game has these properties, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">Does my design have a special feeling of life, or do parts of my design feel dead? What would make my design feel more alive?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Which of Alexander&#8217;s fifteen qualities does my design have?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Could it have more of them, somehow?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Where does my design feel like <i>myself?</i></p></li>

<p class="noindent">Alexander&#8217;s &#8220;deep fundamentals&#8221; perspective on architecture is useful, but it is also useful to look in detail at some of the peculiarities special to virtual architecture. When we study some of the spaces that have been made for popular videogames, they are often very strange. They have huge amounts of wasted space, weird and dangerous architectural features, and no real relationship with their outside environment, and sometimes areas even overlap with themselves in physically impossible ways.</p>
<p class="indent">These sorts of bizarre building constructs would be considered madness by real-world architects. Look at those weird hollow spaces and all that water. So why is it that when we play videogames, we don&#8217;t notice how strange the building layouts are?</p>
<p class="indent">It is because the human mind is very weak when it comes to translating 3D spaces into 2D maps. If you don&#8217;t believe me, think of a familiar place, somewhere you go all the time like your home, school, or workplace, and try to draw a map of it. Most people find this quite difficult&#8212;this simply isn&#8217;t how we store spaces in our minds&#8212;we think of them relatively, not absolutely. We know which doors go to which rooms, but as for what is behind a wall with no doors, we aren&#8217;t always quite sure. For that reason, it is not important that 3D spaces have realistic 2D blueprints. All that matters is how the space feels when the player is in it.</p>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec21_4_1"><span class="pd_orange">Know How Big</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">When we are in real spaces, a sense of scale comes naturally to us, because we have so many cues&#8212;lighting, shadows, textures, stereo vision, and, most importantly, the presence of our own bodies. But in virtual spaces, scale is not always so clear. Because so many real-world cues are missing, it is very easy to create a virtual space that is really much bigger or smaller than it looks. This can be very confusing and disorienting for players. I frequently have conversation with students and other novice world builders that go something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="speech">Virtual Architect: My world looks funny&#8230; but I don&#8217;t know why&#8230;</p>
<p class="speech">Me: Well, things seem out of scale&#8212;that car is too big for the street, and those windows are too small for that building. How big is that car, anyway?</p>
<p class="speech">Virtual Architect: I don&#8217;t know&#8230; Maybe five units?</p>
<p class="speech">Me: So how big is a unit?</p>
<p class="speech">Virtual Architect: I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s all virtual&#8230; why does it matter?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">And in one sense, he&#8217;s right&#8212;as long as everything in your world is in proper proportion, your virtual units could be feet, meters, cubits, or Smurf hats, and it doesn&#8217;t matter. But the moment that anything is out of scale, or you suspect it might be out of scale, it becomes a very important question, because then you have to relate things back to the real world. For this reason, it is wise to make your game units something that you are intimately familiar with in the real world&#8212;for most people, feet or meters. This will save a lot of time and confusion, because if your units are feet, and your car is thirty units long, you will quickly know what the problem is.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="p406" aria-label=" page 406. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>But sometimes the elements of your world are properly proportioned, but to the players, things look out of scale. The typical culprits in this case include the following:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list"><b>Eye height</b>: If you have a first-person game with the virtual camera very high (more than seven feet off the ground) or very low (less than five feet off the ground), it will distort the view of the world, since people tend to assume an eye height similar to their own.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>People and doorways</b>: Two of the strongest cues for scale are people and doorways (which of course, are designed to accommodate people). If you have a world of giants or little people, it can confuse the player about scale; similarly, if you have decided that doorways are very large or very small in your game, that can be similarly confusing. If you have no people, doorways, or other commonly sized man-made objects, players often can get a little confused about scale.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Texture scaling</b>: An easy error to make when designing a world is to have textures that are not at the proper scale, such as a brick texture on the wall that is too large or a floor tile texture that is too small. Be sure that the textures you use match the scale of textures in the real world.</p></li>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec21_4_2"><span class="pd_orange">Third-Person Distortion</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">There is another special peculiarity of designing virtual spaces. Each of us has developed a natural sense of the relationship of how our bodies fit into the world that we see. When we play a third-person videogame, where we can see our body, our brain does an amazing thing; it somehow lets us be in two places at once&#8212;in the body of our character, but also floating eight feet behind our body&#8212;all the while letting this strange perspective feel very natural. And while we get tremendous benefits from being able to see our virtual body in a game, something very odd happens to our sense of proportion. In wide-open outdoor scenes, we mostly don&#8217;t notice this. But when we try to control a character who is in a normal-sized interior space, the space feels frustratingly crowded, like we are driving around a house in a car.</p>

<p class="indent"><span id="p407" aria-label=" page 407. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Weirdly, most players do not identify this as a problem with the third-person avatar system, but they think the room too small. Is there a way to distort the room so that when it is experienced in this peculiar perspective it looks normal?</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Solution 1: Scale up the room and the furniture</b>. If you scale up all the walls and furniture, it does make more room to move around but gives a weird feeling of your avatar being tiny like a small child, as normal-sized objects like chairs and sofas become too big to sit on.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Solution 2: Scale up the room, but leave the furniture normal size</b>. Now you have a cavernous room with furniture huddled together in lonely looking clusters.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Solution 3: Scale up the room, leave the furniture normal size, but spread the furniture out</b>. This works a little better&#8212;the room no longer seems such a cavern, but it leaves the room looking strangely sparse, with unnaturally large spaces between objects in the room.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Solution 4: Scale up the room, scale up the furniture a little bit, and spread the furniture out</b>. This solution, pioneered by the designers of Max Payne, works very well. In a first-person view, this looks kind of strange, but in a third-person view, it does a very good job of counteracting the distortion caused by the eyepoint being far from the body.</p>

<p class="noindent">We&#8217;re nearly at the end of this chapter, and we haven&#8217;t yet talked about level design. Or have we? In truth, we have been covering it all along! Not just in this chapter, but through the entire book. All a level designer does is arrange the architecture, props, and challenges in a game in ways that are fun and interesting&#8212;that is, making sure there is the right level of challenge, the right amount of reward, the right amount of meaningful choice, and all the other things that make a good game. Level design is just game design exercised in detail&#8212;and it isn&#8217;t easy, for the devil is in the details. Level design is different for every game, because every game is different. But if you use everything you know about game design when you design your level, examining it carefully through many lenses, the best level design choices will start to become clear.</p>
