<p class="noindent">In May of 1977, the film <i>Star Wars</i> premiered. It was a surprise hit with young and old alike, but especially with the young. Children were going to see it again and again. It took nearly a year for Kenner Toys to produce a line of action figures based on the movie characters, but even a year after the film&#8217;s release, the toys were a tremendous success, selling as fast as they could be produced and continuing to sell well for years. Other Star Wars merchandise was produced&#8212;posters, jigsaw puzzles, sleeping bags, paper plates, and just about everything else you can imagine&#8212;but nothing was as popular as the action figures.</p>

<p class="indent">Some people believe that selling this kind of merchandise is just a way to cash in on hype and that, ultimately, it cheapens a film. I mean, these toys look kind of cheesy compared to what you see in the movie.</p>
<p class="indent">So, why did they sell so many action figures? For some people, they were just a cool decoration&#8212;something they could look at and remember the film. But for most children, they were something else&#8212;they were a gateway into the <i>Star Wars</i> universe.</p>
<p class="indent">For if you observed children playing with them, you would notice something very strange. Seldom would they act out scenes from the movie, as an adult might expect. Instead, they would make up all kinds of stories featuring these characters with only a loose relationship to the plotline from the movie, which was fairly complex and somewhat difficult for a child to fully comprehend. This might lead you to conclude that it was the characters that were so popular, not the story from <i>Star Wars</i>. But often, you would see children give these characters completely different names, and completely different relationships than they had in the film, as they enacted dramas and comedies starring this cast of characters in bedrooms and backyards everywhere in the world.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="p363" aria-label=" page 363. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>So, if it wasn&#8217;t the plotline or the characters that the kids were so excited by, then what was left? The answer is that it was the world of <i>Star Wars</i> that was so compelling&#8212;and the toys provided another gateway into that world&#8212;one that was better than the movie, in some ways, since it was interactive, participatory, flexible, portable, and social. And weirdly, these toys made the Star Wars world more meaningful for children, not less, because the toys afforded them the ability to visit the world, sculpt it, change it, and make it their own. And as Star Wars sequels started to appear, there was great anticipation, but how much of that anticipation was a desire to hear a new story and how much of it was the excitement of reentering that world?</p>
<p class="indent">Henry Jenkins coined the term transmedia worlds to refer to fantasy worlds that can be entered through many different media&#8212;print, video, animation, toys, games, and many others. This is a very useful concept, for it really is as if the world exists apart from the media that support it. Many people find this a bizarre concept&#8212;they think of books, films, games, and toys as separate things, each standing on their own. But more and more often, the real product that is created is not a story, or a toy, or a game, but a world. But you can&#8217;t sell a world, so these various products are sold as gateways into this world, each leading to different parts of it. And if the world is well constructed, the more gateways you visit, the more real and solid the world will become in your imagination. But if these gateways contradict each other or provide inconsistent information, the world crumbles quickly into dust and ashes, and suddenly the products are worth nothing.</p>
<p class="indent">Why is this? Why do worlds become so real for us, more real than the media that define them? It is because we want them to be real. Some part of us wants to believe that these worlds aren&#8217;t just stories in books, sets of rules, or actors on a screen, but that these worlds actually exist and that maybe, somehow, someday, we can find our way to them.</p>
<p class="indent">This is why people so casually throw out magazines but hesitate before throwing out a comic book&#8212;after all, there&#8217;s a world in there.</p>

<section class="level3">
<h2 class="h3" id="sec19_2"><span class="pd_orange">The Power of Pok&#233;mon</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Pok&#233;mon is arguably one of the most successful transmedia worlds of all time. Since its introduction, the combined sales of all Pok&#233;mon products combined is over $90 billion, making it the second most lucrative videogame franchise of all time, second only to Mario. And though many tried to write it off as a short-term fad, over fifteen years later, new Pok&#233;mon games are consistently top sellers. It is worth understanding the history of Pok&#233;mon to better understand the power of its transmedia world.</p>
<p class="indent">Pok&#233;mon began as a game for the Nintendo Game Boy system. Its designer, Tajiri Satoshi, had collected insects as a boy, and seeing the &#8220;game link&#8221; feature that allowed message passing between two Game Boys in 1991, he had a vision of insects traveling along the cable. He approached Nintendo about the idea, and then he and his team spent five years developing and perfecting the title. In 1996, <i>Pocket Monsters</i> (the direct translation of the Japanese title) as a pair of games (red and <span id="p364" aria-label=" page 364. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>green) was launched. It was essentially a traditional RPG (not unlike <i>Ultima</i> or <i>Final Fantasy</i>), except that you could capture the monsters you fought and make them part of your team.</p>
<p class="indent">The graphics and game action were not elaborate or advanced&#8212;but the interactions were rich and interesting, since the team had spent five years to properly balance the game. It is important to realize how primitive the graphics really were. The original Game Boy only allowed four shades of olive for the graphics, and two battling Pok&#233;mon would basically stand next to each other and wiggle as the player chose attacks from a simple menu.</p>
<p class="indent">The game was a huge success&#8212;so much so that a comic book and an anime series were soon planned. Unlike many TV shows that are only loosely connected to the videogame they were based on (e.g., the dreadful Hanna Barbera <i>Pac-Man</i> cartoon), the Pok&#233;mon show reflected the intricate rules of the gameplay very closely, and the adventures of the main character were directly based on the quest path through the Game Boy game. The result was a show that so mirrored the mechanics of the game, that watching it players better understood what strategies to use in the game.</p>
<p class="indent">But most importantly, the TV show gave players a new gateway into the Pok&#233;mon universe&#8212;one that showed the Pok&#233;mon in full color with dramatic animation and sound. When viewers would return to the Game Boy, these vivid images were retained in their imaginations, making the crudeness of Game Boy graphics and sound completely irrelevant. As mentioned in <a class="nounder" href="C16_chapter13.xhtml#chapter13">Chapter 13</a>: <a class="nounder" href="C16_chapter13.xhtml#chapter13"><i>Balance</i></a>, this is sometimes called the &#8220;binocular effect,&#8221; so named because it is like when people take binoculars to a sporting event or opera glasses to the theater. No one watches the whole event through the binoculars. Instead, the binoculars are used early on to give a close-up view of the distant figures. Once someone has seen them close up, they can map that image onto the tiny figures they see on the stage in their visual imagination.</p>
<p class="indent">These two gateways had tremendous synergy&#8212;wanting to succeed at the game gave reasons to watch the TV show, and watching the TV show made playing the game more vivid and exciting.</p>
<p class="indent">And if this wasn&#8217;t enough, in 1999, Nintendo worked with Wizards of the Coast, the company that produced the breakthrough <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> collectible card game, to create a new collectible card game, based on the world of Pok&#233;mon. This game, like the TV show, held as closely as possible to the core mechanics of the Game Boy game. This gave players a third method of entry into this world&#8212;one that was both portable and very social. Although the Game Boy game featured the game link cable for trading Pok&#233;mon, the truth was that players only used it occasionally&#8212;most of the time, it was played as a solo adventure. Not so with the card game&#8212;its low price and accessibility made it very popular with children (especially boys), playing off their interest in competing with their peers and fitting in naturally with the Pok&#233;mon slogan of &#8220;Gotta catch&#8217;em all!&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">These three complementary gateways into a single solid world made the property a near unstoppable force. People who didn&#8217;t understand the Pok&#233;mon universe <span id="p365" aria-label=" page 365. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>were completely bewildered: Is this thing a game, or a TV show, or what? What is it about the storyline that is so great that kids want to spend all this money on it? I was fortunate enough to be at a roundtable discussion in 1999 with the head of a major entertainment company. Someone asked him what he thought of &#8220;this Pok&#233;mon craze,&#8221; and he replied, &#8220;The movie comes out in a few months, and that&#8217;ll be the end of it.&#8221; He was wrong, of course, because he fundamentally did not get the idea of transmedia worlds. He was completely mired in the old Hollywood way of thinking about story worlds&#8212;a big Hollywood movie defines the world, then there are toys, games, and TV shows that mimic that. The idea of a world that could be based in the ruleset of a handheld videogame or a world that could get stronger with each new medium you add to it was completely unfamiliar to him (he is not in charge of that company any longer).</p>
<p class="indent">The strength of Pok&#233;mon is not just in the game concept, but in the careful and consistent use of multiple media as gateways into a single, well-defined world.</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec19_3"><span class="pd_orange">Properties of Transmedia Worlds</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Transmedia worlds have several properties that make them interesting.</p>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec19_3_1"><span class="pd_orange">Transmedia Worlds Are Powerful</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Successful transmedia worlds exert a powerful effect over fans. It is stronger than just a fan&#8217;s love of an interesting story. It is almost as if the world becomes a sort of personal utopia that they fantasize about visiting. Sometimes, these fantasies are short term, but for many, they are long term, lasting on through their lives. For some, these long-term fantasies are something they turn to, now and then, for a sort of mental break. An adult who keeps a Transformer toy around as a decoration might be a good example of this. The toy gives them a convenient mental gateway to the world of Transformers that they can visit occasionally.</p>
<p class="indent">But for others, the passion for this personal utopia becomes something they actively engage in every day. Such was certainly the case with Scott Edward Nall, who on his 30th birthday legally changed his name to Optimus Prime, one of the lead robots in the Transformers Universe. In fact, if you look at &#8220;hardcore fans&#8221; of any kind of fiction, you will find that in almost all cases, the properties with the most devoted fans are the ones that are the strongest transmedia worlds. <i>Star Trek</i>, <i>Star Wars</i>, <i>Transformers</i>, <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, Marvel Comics, <i>Harry Potter</i>, and many other popular properties have a world at their core. More than the enjoyment of a good storyline, or the appreciation of interesting characters, the desire to enter a fantasy world seems to be what propels these fans to such extremes. As we discussed in <a class="nounder" href="C20_chapter17.xhtml#chapter17">Chapter 17</a>: <a class="nounder" href="C20_chapter17.xhtml#chapter17"><i>Story</i></a>, fantasy is such an important concept in games that often forms the anchor for your world. To be sure you remember to capture the epic power of fantasy, take this lens.</p>

<p class="noindent">Everyone has secret wishes and desires. To be sure your world fulfills them, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">What fantasy does my world fulfill?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Who does the player fantasize about being?</p></li>

<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec19_3_2"><span class="pd_orange">Transmedia Worlds Are Long Lived</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Solid transmedia worlds continue for a surprisingly long time. Superman appeared over seventy-five years ago. James Bond has been around for sixty years. <i>Star Trek</i> and <i>Doctor Who</i> still thrive after fifty years. Walt Disney realized the power of transmedia as he started developing comic books to help keep the worlds of his animation properties alive and created Disneyland to this same end. One of his strongest arguments for investing in such an unusual venture was that it would help keep up the public&#8217;s interest in Disney films by giving them another gateway into the world of the films. The Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 extended the length of corporate copyrights from 75 to 95&#8201;years. This was greatly spurred by the fact that some still lucrative properties (such as early Mickey Mouse cartoons) were in danger of falling into the public domain. Right or wrong, some have suggested that one of the reasons that this act passed seems to be that it just feels wrong to let a carefully managed, well-beloved world fall into the wrong hands.</p>
<p class="indent">One very good reason to cultivate a strong transmedia world is that if you do it well, it can be profitable for a very long time. This seems particularly true for worlds that appeal to children&#8212;when the children grow into adulthood, they often want to share the worlds with their children, creating a cycle that can go on a very long time.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec19_3_3"><span class="pd_orange">Transmedia Worlds Evolve over Time</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">But these worlds do not remain static over time&#8212;they evolve. Consider a transmedia world over a hundred years old (and still popular!): the world of Sherlock Holmes. When we think of Sherlock Holmes today, we typically think of him in <span id="p367" aria-label=" page 367. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>his trademark deerstalker cap and oversized calabash pipe. But if you read the text of the Sherlock Holmes stories, these items are not mentioned in the text. The cap first appears in illustrations by Sidney Paget, who liked wearing a deerstalker cap himself. Later, actor William Gillette, who portrayed Holmes in a series of plays based on the stories built on that by wearing the unusual hat and adding the oversized pipe because it would be distinct and visible even from the back row of a theater. The plays were immensely popular, so much so that future illustrators of the Holmes stories used photos of Gillette as a model for their illustrations. Weirdly, the pipe and cap have become the icons for Sherlock Holmes&#8212;icons that his creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, never envisioned. But this is the way of transmedia worlds&#8212;as new media provide new gateways to the world, the world itself (or people&#8217;s perception of it, which amounts to the same thing for an imaginary world) changes to accommodate the new gateways.</p>
<p class="indent">Another excellent example of this comes from an even older and more beloved transmedia world&#8212;the world of Santa Claus. If ever there was a fantasy utopia that people truly want to be real, it is Santa&#8217;s world&#8212;a world where once a year a benevolent figure carefully considers your heart&#8217;s desire, and gives it to you if you are worthy. Consider the many paths of entry to this world: Not only are there stories, poems, songs, and movies, but you can write him letters, and even visit Santa himself! Just think of it&#8212;a fictional character comes to your house and eats your cookies and then leaves behind a treasure trove of gifts! We so badly want this world to exist that millions of people go to tremendous expense and feats of deception to make children believe it to be an unquestionable reality.</p>
<p class="indent">But who is the author of this world? Like all long-lived transmedia worlds, it was a great collaborative effort. Storytellers and artists continually try to augment Santa&#8217;s world. Some succeed, like the introduction of Santa&#8217;s reindeer by Clement Moore in 1823, or the introduction of Rudolph by Robert L. May in 1939. Many others fail. No less a storyteller than L. Frank Baum, the author of the <i>Wizard of Oz</i> stories, failed miserably with his 1902 <i>Life and Adventures of Santa Claus,</i> which attempted to establish Santa&#8217;s origin as a mortal selected for immortality by a council of nymphs, gnomes, and demons.</p>
<p class="indent">Who decides which new features enter a transmedia world, and which ones are rejected? It somehow happens as part of our collective consciousness. Through some unspoken democratic process, everyone just decides whether a particular feature seems appropriate or inappropriate, and the fictional world changes slightly to accommodate. There is no formal decision&#8212;it just happens. If a story feature is well-liked, it takes root. If not, it fades away. In the long run, the world is governed by those who visit it.</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec19_4"><span class="pd_orange">What Successful Transmedia Worlds Have in Common</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Successful transmedia worlds are powerful and valuable&#8212;so what do they have in common?</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list"><span id="p368" aria-label=" page 368. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><b>They tend to be rooted in a single medium</b>: For all of their many gateways, the most successful of the transmedia worlds started out by making a huge splash in just one medium. Sherlock Holmes was serialized fiction. Superman was a comic book. <i>Star Wars</i> was a movie. <i>Star Trek</i> was a TV show. Pok&#233;mon was a handheld game. Transformers were a toy. All of these have appeared in many other forms, but each is at its very strongest when in its original medium.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>They are intuitive</b>: When doing research for <i>Toontown Online</i>, I tried to learn as much as I could about the fictional world of <i>Toontown</i>. As I studied the film <i>Who Framed Roger</i> Rabbit, I realized that very little about <i>Toontown</i> was really described there. The film didn&#8217;t need to describe <i>Toontown</i> in great detail because everyone already knew it existed. Without anyone ever expressly saying it, it was somehow common knowledge that all cartoon characters live together in a cartoon universe that is very different than ours. The creators of Superman and Batman surely never had any intention that their characters shared the world with other superheroes, but it was intuitive to comic readers that these characters lived in the same world&#8212;and so now they do.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>They have a creative individual at their core</b>: The majority of successful transmedia worlds are rooted in the imagination and aesthetic styling of a single individual. People like Walt Disney, Shigeru Miyamoto, L. Frank Baum, Tajiri Satoshi, Jim Henson, J.K. Rowling, and George Lucas are all examples. Occasionally, small, tight teams are able to create successful transmedia worlds, but it is very rare indeed for successful worlds to be created by large teams. There is something about the holistic vision of a world that comes to a single individual that gives it the strength, solidity, integrity, and beauty necessary to survive the pressure of many gateways.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>They facilitate the telling of many stories</b>: Successful transmedia worlds are never based around a single plotline. They have a solidity and an interconnectedness that goes far beyond that. They leave room for future stories and for guests to imagine their own stories.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>They make sense through any of their gateways</b>: One kiss of death for almost any movie is the phrase &#8220;It makes more sense if you read the book.&#8221; You never know which gateway guests might enter first, so you must make all of them equally inviting and welcoming. Pok&#233;mon certainly succeeded in this regard&#8212;its TV show, comic, video, and card games were each understandable and enjoyable in their own right. Any of these could be a first encounter with the world of Pok&#233;mon that might lead to other ports of entry later on.</p>
<p class="indent">A counterexample would be some of the things that were attempted with the world of <i>The Matrix</i>. Enter <i>The Matrix,</i> a critically panned videogame based on the second film, <i>Matrix: Reloaded</i>, took the novel approach of not telling the story of the movie, but rather a parallel story that intersected with the movie. This was an interesting idea, but if you didn&#8217;t see the movie, it was confusing. Similarly, <i>Animatrix</i>, a series of animated shorts that happen in the <i>Matrix</i> universe only <span id="p369" aria-label=" page 369. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>make sense if the viewer is already intimate with the <i>Matrix</i> universe. This &#8220;it only makes sense if you enter through all the gateways&#8221; approach was intriguing for a few, but alienating for most.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>They are often about discovery</b>: This makes sense because a world about discovery encourages visits from many gateways.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>They are about wish fulfillment</b>: Imagining a fantasy world is a lot of work. Players will not do it unless it is a world that they truly would like to visit&#8212;a world that fulfills some deep and important wish.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Transmedia worlds are the future of entertainment. It is no longer sufficient to focus just on creating a great experience in a single medium. Increasingly, designers are asked to create new gateways to existing worlds&#8212;not an easy task. But those who can create gateways that excite players by creatively giving them a new perspective on and enjoyment of a known world are much sought after. But even more sought after are those who can invent a successful transmedia world starting with nothing but an understanding of their audience&#8217;s secret wishes. If you want to create or improve transmedia worlds, use this lens.</p>
