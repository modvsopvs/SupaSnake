<p class="noindent">If you are going to get someone to fund your game, publish your game, or distribute your game, you are going to have to convince them that your game is worth the risk, and this means pitching your game. You might be thinking, &#8220;Why me? Isn&#8217;t it enough that I&#8217;m designing it? Couldn&#8217;t someone else do this?&#8221; But, really, who is more qualified than you? The artists? The engineers? The management? As the game&#8217;s designer, you should know the game and why it is great better than anyone else. And if you don&#8217;t believe in your game enough to get up in front of people and sing its praises, then why should anyone else believe in it?</p>
<p class="indent">So, who will you pitch to, and when? It depends a lot on your situation. Part-time indie devs will have different pitch requirements than full-time developers in huge companies, but both will have to do a lot of pitching to make a successful game. In the beginning, you&#8217;ll be pitching rough ideas to team members and potential partners. When the team has agreed on a general concept, you might be pitching to management or to funders to get approval to build a prototype. When the prototype is built, you might be pitching your game to publishers or to Kickstarter to get development funds. And during development, when you realize that the game has to change in some important way, you&#8217;ll be pitching those changes to almost everyone. After the game is done, you&#8217;ll need to pitch it to reporters at game conferences. Pitches can be big: &#8220;Here&#8217;s why I need $75M for my new AAA game idea.&#8221; Or it can be tiny: &#8220;Bob, here&#8217;s why the corners on the spaceship need to be more rounded.&#8221; If you are going to develop games, you will constantly need to persuade people about your ideas, and you will constantly be in a position where you have to get people of every discipline and background to stand together behind an idea. The highest-pressure pitches are the ones where you are trying to get funding for the game, so this chapter will focus a little more on those.</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec31_2"><span class="pd_orange">A Negotiation of Power</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Before we get into the specifics of putting together a good pitch, we should take a moment to understand exactly what a pitch is. And to understand that, it is necessary to understand what power is. Power does not have to be about wealth or controlling people, although it can be about those things. Power is simply the ability to get what you want. If you can get what you want, you are powerful. If you can&#8217;t get what you want, you are powerless.</p>
<p class="indent">But notice that our definition of power has two parts: &#8220;the ability to get&#8221; and &#8220;what you want.&#8221; Most people focus entirely on the first part, the ability to get. But the second part, what you want, is equally important. For if you don&#8217;t know what you want, you will find yourself continually grasping and never satisfied. But if you know what you want, you can focus your efforts much more effectively toward getting it, and in doing so, you will become powerful.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="p523" aria-label=" page 523. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>And when you pitch your game, you are entering into a negotiation of power, where you are going to try to get what you want, while you convince someone else that your game is going to help them get what they want. For this reason, the foundation of any successful pitch is knowing what you want and knowing what they want, which can be kind of complicated, keeping in mind that you each have three layers of desire.</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec31_3"><span class="pd_orange">The Hierarchy of Ideas</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Novice designers will frequently be heard to complain, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe it! I pitched this really cool idea, and no one was interested! What is wrong with people?&#8221; The answer is that nothing is wrong with people&#8212;it is just that cool ideas have a pretty low value on the hierarchy of ideas shown here:</p>
<figure class="informaltable">
<img alt="" src="../images/c031_untbl_1.jpg"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">I know that&#8217;s silly, but the point is that when you pitch an idea, it won&#8217;t be judged on its overall merit&#8212;it will be judged by how useful it is, right now, to the person you are pitching it to. Those are the ideas that land deals worth millions. When you pitch a good idea and it gets rejected, don&#8217;t grind your teeth&#8212;take it to someone who can use it, or put it in your back pocket so you have it ready when its time finally comes.</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec31_4"><span class="pd_orange">Twelve Tips for a Successful Pitch</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">So you&#8217;ve learned about who you are pitching to and have figured out a good idea that they can use now, and you even know what you want them to do for you. Now what?</p>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec31_4_1"><span class="pd_orange">Pitch Tip #1: Get in the Door</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">You can&#8217;t pitch your idea if you can&#8217;t get in the door. Some doors are easy to get into, some aren&#8217;t. Big game publishers can be very hard to get an audience with. <span id="p524" aria-label=" page 524. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>They are like the prettiest girl at school, and they know it. They will often ignore e-mails and messages and cancel meetings with almost no warning. They have their pick of developers to work with, so unless you can convince them you have something pretty special, it can be hard to even get in the door, especially if you are using the front door; that is, &#8220;Uh, hello, is this Big Time Games? I have a game design I want to pitch&#8230; who should I talk to?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">A much better approach is to use the back door, if you can; that is, know someone on the inside who can vouch for you. A publisher who would ignore your e-mail won&#8217;t ignore the e-mail of someone they work with on a regular basis. I think it is safe to say that the majority of game deals happen this way&#8212;a developer and a publisher were introduced to each other by a mutual friend. This is why industry events like the Game Developers Conference and local International Game Developer Association (IGDA) meetings are so important&#8212;they help you build up networks of contacts so that when your pitch is ready, you can get in the door.</p>
<p class="indent">Even if you are just pitching someone within your company, though, the same principle applies. The people who have the most power to make decisions about schedule and budget are the busiest. They are much more likely to hear you out and take you seriously if they already know you, like you, and trust you.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec31_4_2"><span class="pd_orange">Pitch Tip #2: Show You Are Serious</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">When I worked at Walt Disney Imagineering, there was a remarkable event, held twice a year, called the Open Forum. It was an opportunity to pitch your brilliant idea to the top creative minds in charge of the Disney theme parks. Anyone at all in the entire organization was welcome to come and give their five-minute pitch to this panel of decision makers. They would then deliberate privately for five minutes and then give you five minutes of feedback. If they liked the idea, it would get taken to the next level and possibly get deployed in the parks! I loved the idea of getting a chance to pitch new ideas and would take advantage every time I could. Generally, I would be well prepared, but for one of the sessions, I just didn&#8217;t have the time. Instead of giving one fully fleshed out idea, I thought maybe I would come in with two less-fleshed-out ones. One was a fountain made of soap bubbles, and the other was a mini campfire for a restaurant so that guests could roast marshmallows right at their tables. When I presented these ideas, the panel had many questions. Would the fountain actually work? Would the mini campfire be safe? Had I built prototypes to answer these questions? I had to admit that I hadn&#8217;t. One panel member became indignant: &#8220;If you don&#8217;t care enough about these ideas to try them out, why should we?&#8221; It was humiliating, but he was absolutely right.</p>
<p class="indent">When you pitch a game, you have to show that you are serious about building it. It used to be that a developer could get a deal with a publisher just with a few sketches and a description of what the game would be like. That kind of deal is increasingly rare now&#8212;a working prototype is required in this day and age. But even a prototype is not enough&#8212;you need to show that you have given serious <span id="p525" aria-label=" page 525. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>thought to your game, its market, and how it works. This can be with a detailed design document (no one will read it, but they will weigh it) or, even better, with a clear presentation that details why the game will sell. Believing that your game could be fun isn&#8217;t enough&#8212;you must show you&#8217;ve done the work that proves your game will be fun and will monetize.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec31_4_3"><span class="pd_orange">Pitch Tip #3: Be Organized</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p class="quote"><i>Organization is not a burden. Organization will set you free.</i></p>
<p class="right">&#8212;Alton Brown</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">It&#8217;s real easy to fall into the &#8220;creative people aren&#8217;t organized&#8221; trap. Organization is just another way to show someone that you are serious. Also, the more organized you are, having just what you need at your fingertips, the calmer you&#8217;ll be, and the more in control you will be. A publisher is going to see an organized designer as a &#8220;lower-risk&#8221; designer, which will make them more likely to trust you.</p>
<p class="indent">So make sure your pitch is well planned. If you bring paper handouts, make sure they are easily accessible and that you have enough for everybody. If your presentation involves a computer, a projector, or (gulp) an Internet connection, make sure that they are really going to work&#8212;bring all the right cables, and get there early to test, just in case. I once scheduled a very important pitch with someone where we set a date but forgot to set a time! The day before I was scrambling to get in touch with them, to figure out if our meeting was still on and when exactly it would be! The whole thing was stressful, embarrassing, and unnecessary.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec31_4_4"><span class="pd_orange">Pitch Tip #4: Be Passionate!!!!!</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Unbelievably to me, I see pitches all the time where the person presenting seems kind of ambivalent about the game they are talking about. You want to get the people you are talking to excited about your game&#8212;to do that, you must be excited about your game! DO NOT try to fake this&#8212;it will come off completely phony. If you are actually, genuinely excited about your game when you talk about it, it will come through in the presentation, and it might even be infectious! And passion represents more than excitement&#8212;it also represents drive and commitment to deliver a quality game at any cost. Funders need to see this kind of commitment if they are going to entrust you with the necessary funding to produce your genius game.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec31_4_5"><span class="pd_orange">Pitch Tip #5: Assume Their Point of View</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">In previous chapters, we&#8217;ve talked about the importance of listening to your audience, your game, and your team&#8212;the pitch is just one more occasion for <span id="p526" aria-label=" page 526. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>listening. So often we assume that selling is all about us&#8212;if only we push hard enough, they&#8217;ll buy it. But no one likes to be confronted with a hard, pushy salesperson. What we like is when someone listens to us and tries to solve our problems. Your pitch should be all about that. Speak with the person you are going to pitch to in advance. Learn what you can about them, and make sure that the game you are planning to pitch is going to be a good fit for them&#8212;if it isn&#8217;t, don&#8217;t waste their time.</p>
<p class="indent">Even though you know the game you are pitching backward and forward, you must remember the person you are pitching to has never seen it before, so make sure you explain it in a way that they will easily understand&#8212;avoid jargon wherever possible. Practice your pitch on friends and colleagues who aren&#8217;t familiar with the game idea to see if it makes sense to them.</p>
<p class="indent">Also remember that the person you are pitching to has probably seen hundreds of pitches and is very busy. Make sure that you don&#8217;t waste any time and get straight to the point. If they seem bored with a point you are making, pass over it and move on. If there is something they want more details about, they will ask questions.</p>
<p class="indent">One more way to assume the client&#8217;s point of view: consider the best-case scenario. That is, they LOVE your pitch. Now what happens? In most cases, a deal can&#8217;t happen yet. The person you pitched to probably has to pitch it to colleagues or superiors at their company. How easy have you made it for them? Here are the things that make it much easier for a &#8220;fan&#8221; of your project to pitch it to others:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list"><b>Start by stating your platform, audience, and genre</b>: Novice designers often want to keep people in suspense, unveiling what the game is halfway through the presentation. This is always a terrible idea. Tell them, right away, the platform, the audience, and genre. If you don&#8217;t, they won&#8217;t hear a word you say because their minds will be obsessed with trying to figure out what kind of game this is so they can decide if they even care about it or not.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Do not begin by telling a story</b>: I&#8217;m sure your story is great. But guess what? Lots of lousy games have great stories, and lots of great games have lousy stories. Instead of telling them the legendary backstory of the land of Nurl, pull out <a href="C22_chapter19.xhtml#box83">Lens #83</a>: <i><a href="C22_chapter19.xhtml#box83">Fantasy</a></i>, and tell them what fantasy the game fulfills.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Give your idea &#8220;handles&#8221;</b>: That is, provide short phrases that summarize the idea: &#8220;It&#8217;s a bowling RPG!&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s <i>Pok&#233;mon</i> for grownups!&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s <i>Nintendogs</i>, with a whole zoo!&#8221; This will help them get the concept and make it easier for them to explain it to others.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Show, don&#8217;t tell</b>: Got a working version? Great&#8212;show that! Even better, show a video that highlights the best features of it. If it&#8217;s too early in the process for that, at a minimum, create a slide show of what it is like to play the game. This is by far the best way to make them understand what you have in mind.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Make it easy for <i>them</i></b> <b>to pitch</b>: Rarely are you pitching to someone who can independently make a final decision. Usually, the best case is that they love what you showed them and now they have to go convince their colleagues that it&#8217;s a good idea. Create pitch materials that speak for themselves, which don&#8217;t require <span id="p527" aria-label=" page 527. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>you to be in the room giving a song and dance to be compelling. Arm them with key images, short videos, and self-explanatory bullet lists so that they can pitch it as well as you can.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec31_4_6"><span class="pd_orange">Pitch Tip #6: Design the Pitch</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The pitch is an experience, right? Why wouldn&#8217;t you design it at least as well as your game! Lots of lenses from this book will help you do it. Your pitch should be accessible, have surprises, have a good interest curve (a hook, a build, tense and release, a climax), etc. It should have a good aesthetic design, favoring images over words whenever possible. Your pitch should be elegant, focusing primarily on what is unique about your game, why it will succeed against the competition, and why it is a good fit for the person you are pitching it to. And whenever possible, your pitch should dazzle. Look for little ways you can impress them with flourishes of showmanship. Detailed animations, unexpected sound effects, humorous images, physical props, and anything else you can think of can help make it a great and memorable pitch. Even your venue can make a difference: I once had to pitch game about mummies to a publisher who was visiting New York City. I made arrangements so that we could do the pitch in the Egyptian wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in sight of actual mummies and tombs. The publisher was dazzled, and we got the project. If you can make even a simple PowerPoint presentation overflow with showmanship, it will give them confidence that you&#8217;ll do that and more when you make the game.</p>
<p class="indent">You should think through every moment that will happen during the entire pitch encounter. Will you have other team members there? When will you introduce them? When will you show your prototype? If you think that &#8220;overplanning&#8221; will spoil the energy of your pitch, you are wrong. You can always deviate from a plan if you want to, but having a plan will keep your mind free to focus on giving a great pitch, and you won&#8217;t have to worry about whether you have forgotten something important.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec31_4_7"><span class="pd_orange">Pitch Tip #7: Know All the Details</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">During a pitch, you are going to get questions. Experienced, busy publishers aren&#8217;t going to wait until the end, either&#8212;they will break into your carefully planned presentation and ask detailed questions about the things they think are important. You need to have as many facts as possible at your fingertips. These include the following:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list"><b>Design details</b>: You should know your design inside and out. For parts of the design you&#8217;ve been putting off, you should at least have a guess. You should have confident answers for questions like &#8220;How many hours of gameplay?&#8221; &#8220;How long does it take to finish a level?&#8221; &#8220;How does multiplayer work?&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span id="p528" aria-label=" page 528. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><b>Schedule details</b>: You need to know how long it will take to create the game and roughly how long it will take your team to get to each of the important milestones (design document completed, first playable prototype, first alpha, second alpha, beta, launch date, frequency of postlaunch updates). Make sure these times are realistic, or your audience will lose confidence in you fast. Be ready for the question: &#8220;What&#8217;s the fastest you could get this done?&#8221; Expect to be held to your answer.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Financial details</b>: You should know what it will cost to get the game done. This means knowing how many people will be working on the game, how long they&#8217;ll be working on it, and other costs. Also expect the question: &#8220;How much money will this make?&#8221; You should probably base that answer on how comparable titles have monetized. Don&#8217;t just give one number&#8212;give what you think is a reasonable range. Make ABSOLUTELY sure that the minimum number you give still makes the game a profitable venture.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Risks</b>: You will be asked what the biggest risks on the project are. You need to be ready to state them clearly and succinctly, along with your plan for managing each one of them whether they are technical, gameplay, aesthetic, marketing, financial, or legal.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">You also need to anticipate the questions that the people you are pitching to are going to ask. There is a legend about Imagineer Joe Rohde who was giving the final pitch of the Animal Kingdom theme park to Disney CEO Michael Eisner. Eisner had long wavered about whether this park was a good idea, and Joe was given his last chance to explain why it was. After Joe&#8217;s detailed presentation, Eisner said, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&#8230; I still don&#8217;t see what is so exciting about live animals.&#8221; Joe walked out of the meeting and returned, moments later, leading a Bengal tiger into the room. &#8220;This,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;is what is so exciting about live animals.&#8221; The theme park got its funding. When you can anticipate what questions are coming and give perfect answers, you can be magically persuasive.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec31_4_8"><span class="pd_orange">Pitch Tip #8: Exude Confidence</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">While passion is important, confidence is just as important and not at all the same thing. Being confident means you are sure your game will be perfect for the client and that your team is the perfect team to pull it off. It means not getting shaken when you get a tough question. It means knowing all the details. Keep in mind, you aren&#8217;t just selling the idea, you are selling yourself. If you seem nervous, it&#8217;s going to make people think you don&#8217;t believe what you are saying. When you show something impressive, you should act like it was nothing, like it was easy. If your other team members are with you, you should answer questions as a team with each confident about which questions the others can answer best.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="p529" aria-label=" page 529. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>And here is a magic word you can use when a tough question tries to shake your confidence: &#8220;Absolutely.&#8221; For questions like &#8220;Do you think this will sell in Europe?&#8221; &#8220;Can the servers handle the load?&#8221; &#8220;Can you make a kid&#8217;s version?&#8221; You might be thinking &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;probably,&#8221; but I guarantee that &#8220;absolutely&#8221; will sound far more confident. Of course you need to back up that confident answer!</p>
<p class="indent">And a quick word about handshakes: if you aren&#8217;t sure you have a confident handshake, you need to practice until you do. Handshakes are a secret language of the subconscious, a system by which people (especially men) assess personalities. Your words may sound confident, but if your handshake is not, it will cast doubt on everything you say. After all, if you can&#8217;t manage to be in sync with someone for two pumps and squeeze of the hand, how will the rest of the working relationship go?</p>
<p class="indent">But what if you don&#8217;t feel confident? What if you get really nervous talking in front of a group? The best thing to do is visualize a time when you were supremely confident. Putting yourself into that past moment will help you remember what confidence feels like and that you can be a confident person calmly in charge of an important situation.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec31_4_9"><span class="pd_orange">Pitch Tip #9: Be Flexible</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">During your pitch, you are going to get curveballs. The person you are pitching to might suddenly reveal they hate your concept&#8212;what else do you have? You might have planned on a one-hour meeting only to be told &#8220;I only have twenty minutes.&#8221; You need to handle these kinds of things with coolness and confidence. Game designer Richard Garfield tells a story about how he went to a publisher to pitch RoboRally, an elaborate board game about robots in a factory. Garfield loved his game and gave a detailed pitch to a game publisher who sat patiently through it and then said, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but we can&#8217;t use this. It&#8217;s too big. We&#8217;re looking for games that are small and portable. Got anything like that?&#8221; Garfield could have walked out, insulted, but instead he stayed objective and considered that his goal was to get a game published&#8212;not necessarily this game. He mentioned that he was working on an idea for a new kind of card game&#8212;could he come back and present that? The game he pitched the second time eventually became the megahit Magic: The Gathering.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec31_4_10"><span class="pd_orange">Pitch Tip #10: Rehearse</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Planning your pitch is good; rehearsing it is better. The more you get comfortable talking about your game, the more natural your pitch will be. Look for any opportunity to practice&#8212;when your mother asks, &#8220;So, what have you been working on?&#8221; give her the pitch. Give it to your coworkers, to your hairdresser, or to your dog. <span id="p530" aria-label=" page 530. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>It isn&#8217;t that the specific words of your pitch need to be memorized, but the chain of ideas needs to be able to spring forth naturally from you, like a favorite song.</p>
<p class="indent">If you are going to show a demo, rehearse that, too. Avoid, at all costs, pitching while you play! It makes you sound mentally deficient and wastes valuable time. Have a colleague play the game while you talk about it and answer questions. Unless they are excited about it, don&#8217;t expect executives to play your prototype. There is too much danger of them embarrassing themselves or crashing your prototype and embarrassing you.</p>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec31_4_11"><span class="pd_orange">Pitch Tip #11: Get Them to Own It</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">In <a class="nounder" href="C33_chapter30.xhtml#chapter30">Chapter 30</a>: <a class="nounder" href="C33_chapter30.xhtml#chapter30"><i>Client</i></a>, we heard Michelangelo&#8217;s clever method of getting a client to own the project. But you don&#8217;t have to be so sneaky. Ideally, you want them to come away from your pitch thinking of the game as &#8220;their game.&#8221; Having an inside advocate in the group you are pitching to really helps&#8212;someone who is presold on the concept and who will defend it to the others. Another way to improve the chances of them taking ownership is to integrate the ideas of the client into the pitch. If, in a previous conversation with them, they said &#8220;So, it&#8217;s a war game, huh? Does it have helicopters? I love helicopters!&#8221; you should be darn sure there are helicopters in your pitch somewhere. You can even integrate the client&#8217;s ideas on the fly, using concepts from their early questions (&#8220;Could it have giant rats?&#8221;) to explain things later in the pitch (&#8220;So, say you come upon a room full of giant rats&#8230;&#8221;). The easier you make it for them to imagine that it is their game, the closer they will be to accepting your proposal.</p>

<p class="noindent">After your pitch, they will thank you and promise to get back to you. And they might&#8212;but they might just as easily not. This doesn&#8217;t mean that they didn&#8217;t like your pitch. They might have liked it very much but gotten swept up in some other, more pressing emergency. Within a few days of the pitch, you should find an excuse to follow up with them by email (&#8220;you had asked about details of the texture manager, and I just wanted to get back to you on that&#8221;) to subtly remind them that you are still around and that they owe you feedback. You have no good reason to nag them outright for an answer&#8212;if you do, you are likely to get an answer quickly: &#8220;no thanks.&#8221; They may need time to think about it, time to discuss internally, or time to review other competing proposals. Just keep following up periodically, not too often, until you get an answer. Never get frustrated if they don&#8217;t respond&#8212;be patient and understanding. It may be that the time for your idea to be useful just isn&#8217;t here yet. It is not uncommon to ping a publisher six months after a pitch and to hear back, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m glad you contacted me. Remember that pitch you gave? I think we might want to talk to you about it. Can we meet next week?&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec31_5"><span id="p531" aria-label=" page 531. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="pd_orange">Hey, What about Kickstarter?</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Ah, crowdsourcing. It seems like the perfect solution! Why should you have to pitch to some executive, when you can take your game right to the people and sell it to them before you even make it! Some designers have raised millions of dollars this way, why not you?</p>
<p class="indent">Kickstarter and its many cousins have certainly been a wonderful thing for some game developers, but most game developers who try to crowdfund fail. Why? Many of them fail to follow the aforementioned pitch tips&#8212;all the rules about getting right to the point, seeming organized, capturing the imagination, showing instead of telling, and dazzling the viewer are just as true in a video pitch as they are when you pitch in person. But there are some very specific things that people don&#8217;t realize about crowdfunding as well:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list"><b>It&#8217;s a lot of work</b>: Preparing and running a crowdfunding campaign is a huge amount of work. Expect to take a full month to design and build your page and video, a full month to run the campaign, and then a full month later down the road to fulfill everything you promised (mailing t-shirts, making custom content, etc.). That&#8217;s two or three months you could have spent making your game, and you might not even get the money.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>It&#8217;s really a preorder system</b>: Crowdfunding is not a system of investment, and it is not a charity system. Most people who fund something are doing so because they are excited about getting something special, getting it before everyone else, and getting it at a good price. That&#8217;s great if you have invented, say, a next-generation game controller. But if you plan to crowdfund your free-to-play iOS game, then watch out. Apple (presently) has no means for distributing early versions, and if the game is already free, why would anyone give you $25 before they even know if they like it? Crowdfunding works best with things that have a physical component or with games that have a high ($20+) fixed price.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Ask for as little as possible</b>: You might think that by asking for more funding, it will incentivize the community to give you more. This does not seem to be the case. And with Kickstarter, if you don&#8217;t hit your target, you get nothing. Set the lowest funding target you can manage. If your campaign takes off, you can always get more.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Shorter is better</b>: Sixty days of money sounds like more than thirty days, right? In most cases, no. Shorter campaigns seem to do better. Most campaigns find that they get most of the funding the first week (from people who are sure they want to fund it) and the last week (from people who prefer to wait till the last minute to decide). Whether you have two weeks in the middle or six weeks doesn&#8217;t seem to matter much, but the longer your campaign, the more work it will be, and the more chance there is people will forget about it.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Keep the rewards simple</b>: Remember, it&#8217;s a preorder. Most just want an early release of the game at a good price. T-shirts and other tchotchkes are a nice idea <span id="p532" aria-label=" page 532. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>but won&#8217;t change your funding very much, will be a lot of work to mail out, and may even overwhelm funders with too many choices.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Show, don&#8217;t tell</b>: The most successful game crowdfunding videos show a taste of the game in action, and not much more. Why? Because crowdfunding is really mostly about preorders. Show them a slice of a cool game, and people will step up to buy it. Yap for five minutes about what the game might be, you&#8217;ll have a much harder time.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Hustle</b>: Do anything you can to get the word out about your crowdfunding campaign. Tweet and give updates as often as possible. Set tiny goals &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re almost 10% there! You could be the one to get us to 10%!&#8221; Bother any influential people you help the word out. Don&#8217;t think you can sit back and let the campaign take care of itself&#8212;you have to be pushing it every second.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Have stretch goals</b>: Stretch goals (Our goal is $40K, but if we hit $50K, we&#8217;ll add a blue laser level!) help a great deal with virality, because everyone who funded your game now has a reason to spread the word&#8212;after all, if I can get other people to pledge money, then I&#8217;ll get more for the money I pledged, at no cost to me.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Be famous</b>: There are no two ways about it. The most likely games to get funded are the ones by people who already have a following. If you aren&#8217;t famous, your game better be pretty incredible sounding or have a tiny funding goal.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">In short, crowdfunding is a great move for some games, but not for others. In the end, it&#8217;s a pitch like any other and needs time and attention to be great. Every game begins with an idea, but it gets funded with a pitch. Keep this lens so you don&#8217;t forget to design your pitch as well as you design your game.</p>

<p class="noindent">To ensure your pitch is as good as it can be, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">Why are you pitching this game to this client?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">What will you consider &#8220;a successful pitch&#8221;?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">What&#8217;s in it for the people you are pitching to?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">What do the people you are pitching to need to know about your game?</p></li>
