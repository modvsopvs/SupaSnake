<p class="right">&#8212;Antoine de Saint-Exupery</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">It may seem strange, in a book that is ostensibly meant to instruct about the design of videogames, to wait until so near the end to talk about technology. But there is a reason. Technology looms large in the lives of game designers. And just as it is hard to study the stars when the sun is out, it is hard to study game design when technology is in the room. Technology is ever novel and ever surprising and ever presents new puzzles to solve. Of the four elements in the tetrad (technology, story, aesthetics, and mechanics), technology is the most dynamic, most volatile, and most unpredictable. It&#8217;s like having a drunken billionaire show up at your party&#8212;all eyes are on him because no one knows what he might do. Well, at long last, it is time for us to plunge into the sun, to introduce ourselves to this drunken billionaire.</p>
<p class="indent">So, what is technology, anyway? Do we just mean computers and electronics? No&#8230; we mean something much broader. For a game designer, &#8220;technology&#8221; means the very medium of our game&#8212;the physical objects that make it possible. For Monopoly, the technology is a board, slips of paper, tokens, and dice. For hopscotch, it is a piece of chalk and a sidewalk. For <i>Tetris</i>, it is a computer, a screen, and a simple input device. Saying that technology is just the physical things our game is made of might seem obvious, but this idea has deep implications, because of how technology advances at such a rapid rate. Consider how many physical things have been invented since you were born. Ten thousand? A hundred thousand? A million? <span id="p499" aria-label=" page 499. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>There are so many; it is hard to say for sure. But many of these new inventions can be used to make new kinds of games. And this is important because the quest of the game designer is forever a quest for the new. As we&#8217;ve said before, people buy new games because they are new. Because of this pressure for novelty and the sexiness of new technology, it can be easy to get swept away in the possibilities of what technology can do and forget that our purpose is to create a great game.</p>
<p class="indent">Keeping your head about this, and not getting drunk along with the billionaire, can be a challenge for some people. Engineers, in particular, have a natural love of technology and are especially prone to its siren song. Walt Disney had very strong feelings about this, and in the landmark book, <i>The Illusion of Life</i>, animators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnson relate that</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="quote"><i>For some reason, [Walt] had a distrust of engineers as men who designed primarily for themselves without regard to the intended use of the product, and he refused to have anyone on the staff with the title, &#8220;Engineer.&#8221;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">This is an extreme position, of course, but it underlines the importance of keeping a level head about the place of technology in the experience on you are creating.</p>

<section class="level3">
<h2 class="h3" id="sec29_2"><span class="pd_orange">Foundational vs. Decorational</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">One of the most concrete ways to keep a sane perspective about technology is to understand the difference between foundational and decorational technologies. Foundational technologies are the ones that make a new kind of experience possible. Decorational technologies just make existing experiences better. I find that this illustration helps to make it clear:</p>
<figure class="figure" id="fig29_2">

<p class="title"><span class="pd_orange"><small>FIGURE</small><br/><b>29.2</b></span></p>
<img alt="" src="../images/fig29_2.jpg"/>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The cake part of the cupcake is foundational technology. Without it, there couldn&#8217;t be a cupcake. The cherry and the icing are decorational technology. Adding them doesn&#8217;t make something fundamentally new; it just makes something old a little nicer. Perhaps some examples from entertainment and games will help make this even clearer.</p>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec29_2_1"><span id="p500" aria-label=" page 500. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="pd_orange">Mickey&#8217;s First Cartoon</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">A common trivia question often pops up on quiz shows: &#8220;What was Mickey Mouse&#8217;s first cartoon?&#8221; And most of us know the answer: <i>Steamboat Willie</i>. And most of us, it turns out, are wrong. <i>Steamboat Willie</i> was predated by <i>Plane Crazy</i>, another Mickey cartoon that was released six months earlier. What was so remarkable about <i>Steamboat Willie</i> that it is universally remembered as Mickey&#8217;s premiere? Technology. Specifically, <i>Steamboat Willie</i> was the first cartoon to feature synchronized sound. And the sound was not decorational&#8212;the entire cartoon was designed around having a synchronized soundtrack. The storyline in <i>Steamboat Willie</i> primarily features Mickey and Minnie playing various farm animals as if they were musical instruments. It was cute, clever, and catchy, and without synchronized sound, it would have made no sense whatever. The technology was foundational to the experience the cartoon created. Later, synchronized sound was added to <i>Plane Crazy</i>, but it was decorational: the sounds of growling airplane engines did little to change the fundamental experience of the cartoon.</p>

</figure>
<p class="noindent"><span id="p501" aria-label=" page 501. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>A low-tech example of an interesting foundational technology can be seen in <i>Abalone</i>, a board game invented in 1987 by Laurent Levi and Michel Lalet. The game board looks like the familiar game of Chinese checkers, but it has an important difference: grooves between the holes make it possible to grab one marble and push it so that it pushes a whole row of other marbles along the grooves, so they &#8220;clunk&#8221; into the next holes. Most head-to-head games like this feature game mechanics based on capturing an opponent&#8217;s piece by landing on it or by jumping over it. Levi and Lalet realized that a board that allowed for pushing could feature a brand-new mechanic, and so they designed a game where you capture a piece by shoving it off the board. The grooves were not a complicated technology, but they served as the foundation for a game experience that was completely new.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec29_2_3"><span class="pd_orange">Sonic the Hedgehog</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> and <i>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</i> games for the Sega Genesis were powerful examples of foundational technology. Sega knew that one of the key differentiators between the Sega Genesis console and the competition, Super Nintendo, was that Sega&#8217;s system had an architecture that supported incredibly fast scrolling. The <i>Sonic</i> games (especially <i>Sonic 2</i> with its lightning-fast spin dash) were designed expressly to exploit this ability. Players had never before played a game that featured such incredibly fast movement, and this is part of what made the games feel exciting and new.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec29_2_4"><span class="pd_orange">Myst</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">It is hard today to comprehend how successful <i>Myst</i> was in the marketplace. It was the top selling PC game every month for five consecutive years. Yow. Anyway, this success came because of a mix of foundational and decorational technologies. The first technology was decorational: gorgeous 3D artwork. At the time (1993), computer-generated 3D artwork was something of a novelty. It had a look that was otherworldly and new. But to deliver these pretty pictures in a game required a more foundational technology: the CD-ROM drive. Before the CD-ROM, the detail of imagery in games was mostly limited to pixel art. The CD-ROM made possible games full of glorious images of photographic quality. And Cyan (the makers of <i>Myst</i>) took this very seriously. When CD-ROM drives first came out, they could be very flaky. There were many different manufacturers, many different drivers, and many ways for the software to fail. Cyan made a conscious choice to spend development time making sure their game ran on every possible CD-ROM/PC combination&#8212;time that some on the team would rather have spent giving the game a more elaborate ending. But it would seem they made the right decision&#8212;for years, nearly everyone who bought a CD-ROM drive for their home bought a copy of <i>Myst</i>, because they heard it was beautiful, and unlike many other CD-ROM games, this one was guaranteed to work.</p>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec29_2_5"><span id="p502" aria-label=" page 502. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="pd_orange">Journey</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">No&#8230; not that <i>Journey</i>. In the early 1980s, engineers at Bally Midway had a great idea for a new videogame technology: why not put a digital camera onto an arcade machine, so that players who got a high score could do more than just enter their initials&#8212;they could pose for a picture! They built a prototype that would take black and white digital photos of winners and tried it out in a Chicago arcade. In what may have been the first instance of griefing, they were shocked to visit it the next day to find that several of the winners had &#8220;flashed&#8221; the camera, making their high score list an exhibit of low-res pornography. No one could think of a way to solve this problem, so the management put a halt to further development on the project. But the team didn&#8217;t give up so easily. They had put a lot of work into the technology and wanted to see something come from it. The result was <i>Journey: The Arcade Game</i>, a basic platform game that featured members of the rock band Journey as avatars. These avatars were very strange looking, having tiny cartoon bodies and grossly large heads that were black and white photos of the band members. The technology, which started as something more foundational, ended up as something purely decorational and a pretty ugly decoration at that. The fancy technology could not save a boring game, and it flopped.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec29_2_6"><span class="pd_orange">Ragdoll Physics</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">A more modern example can be seen when considering the technology of &#8220;ragdoll physics.&#8221; Ragdoll physics is a method of manipulating real-time animated characters so that their bodies can realistically interact with other elements in the game world in a way that is not prescripted. Put another way, if you pick up a game character by the arm and shake it around, its limbs will flop around realistically, with the movements completely calculated by the computer&#8212;no animator required. This has been used in countless first-person shooter games as a purely decorational technology: an Non-Player Character (NPC) gets hit with a grenade, and its body flops through the air and onto the ground, using the mathematics of real-time physics to compute the motion. Even though sometimes it doesn&#8217;t look right (the bodies have bad interaction with some types of terrain), it is a minor novelty and the engineers love it.</p>
<p class="indent">Contrast that use with how the same algorithms are used in the game <i>Ico</i>. <i>Ico</i> was a landmark in storytelling games, partly because of the novelty of the interaction between the main character <i>Ico</i> and the princess he is trying to rescue. For most of the game, <i>Ico</i> must lead the princess around by the hand, helping her through all kinds of dangerous perils. Because of the way the princess follows <i>Ico</i>, responding to every tug of his hand as he runs, climbs, and jumps, she seems alive in a way that is completely new and different. Most of the puzzles in the game are based on the fact that <i>Ico</i> has to lead the princess around, which would be impossible without ragdoll physics algorithms. The engineers and designers behind <i>Ico</i> found a way to take a technology that had been used purely as a decoration and turn it into the foundation of a game experience the world had never encountered before.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="p503" aria-label=" page 503. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>As these examples show, it is a good habit, when encountering a new technology, to ask yourself, &#8220;How can I make this foundational to my game?&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec29_3"><span class="pd_orange">The Touch Revolution</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">When touch games first appeared, on platforms like the Nintendo DS and the iPhone, many gamers complained loudly. A touchable screen was poor substitute for a gamepad&#8212;that is, when it tried to mimic a gamepad. Soon, games started to appear that wouldn&#8217;t have been possible without touch (such as <i>Cooking Mama</i> on the DS or <i>Cut the Rope</i> on iOS), and people felt very differently. It&#8217;s always the same story: new technology appears, and people say there is no point to it. That is, until someone designs for it.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3">
<h2 class="h3" id="sec29_4"><span class="pd_orange">The Hype Cycle</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Another good way to ward off the intoxicating effects of technology is to understand the pattern of that intoxication. This is best described through a model created by Gartner Research, which they refer to as the Hype Cycle.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="fig29_4">
<figcaption>
<p class="title"><span class="pd_orange"><small>FIGURE</small><br/><b>29.4</b></span></p>
<img alt="" src="../images/fig29_4.jpg"/>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The preceding graph represents visibility (the number of people talking about it) over time. Gartner suggests that every new technology goes through five phases of hype:</p>
<ol class="list-order">
<li><p class="list"><b>Technology trigger</b>: This is when the technology is first discovered or announced.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Peak of inflated expectations</b>: This is when many more people are talking about the technology than have actually experienced it. In other words, &#8220;nobody knows what it&#8217;s really like, but everyone says it&#8217;s great.&#8221; Companies launching a product (like, say, the new iPhone) try to make the most of this quirk of human nature <span id="p504" aria-label=" page 504. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>to believe that a new technology will make your dreams come true, though this never seems to actually happen.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Trough of disillusionment</b>: When the technology can&#8217;t live up to the incredible hype that surrounded it (like, say, the Segway) and people see it in the cold, harsh light of reality, it quickly becomes unfashionable, even despised.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Slope of enlightenment</b>: Gradually, people and businesses start to figure out the areas where the technology is actually useful and beneficial.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Plateau of productivity</b>: At this point, the benefits of the technology are widely understood and accepted. The height of this plateau is dependent on how broadly useful the technology really is.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">The funny thing about the Hype Cycle is that it happens every time. Somehow, people never seem to learn, and they repeat the same silly behaviors again and again: assuming the &#8220;new thing&#8221; will be life changing, hating it when it isn&#8217;t, and eventually using it for the things it is good at. As a game designer, you need to know about the Hype Cycle for three big reasons:</p>
<ol class="list-order">
<li><p class="list"><b>Immunity</b>: If you are aware of the Hype Cycle, you can make yourself immune to its effects and not risk your career on a technology you haven&#8217;t actually seen work.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Inoculation</b>: Chances are good that at some point you are going to find yourself surrounded by people who have bought into the hype on some crazy new technology, and they will want you to design a game around it. If you can make them understand about the Hype Cycle, you may be able to save your team from making a dangerous decision.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Fund-raising</b>: There is no pretty way to say this. At some point, you are going to have an opportunity to pitch a design to someone who is fully under the spell of inflated expectations, and they are going to be willing to fund your game not because of its merits but because they believe that the technological bandwagon they are jumping on is going to make them very rich. You can try to persuade them of the truth, but it won&#8217;t work. The trick is to get the money before the trough of disillusionment and then to make something great, despite the technology. If you can do this, it will be a roller coaster ride, but you will get the game made.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">It can be very interesting to look back at the launch of different games and game systems and think about their Hype Cycles. I&#8217;ll leave that as an exercise to the reader, though, because we have a dilemma to discuss.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3">
<h2 class="h3" id="sec29_5"><span class="pd_orange">The Innovator&#8217;s Dilemma</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Another pattern anyone working with new technologies needs to be aware of is the innovator&#8217;s dilemma (see <a class="figure" href="C32_chapter29.xhtml#fig29_5">Figure 29.5</a>), from the book of the same name by Clayton <span id="p505" aria-label=" page 505. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Christensen. The basic idea is that technology companies often fail because they make the mistake of listening to their customers. This sounds counterintuitive&#8212;as we&#8217;ve discussed, listening to the people who play your games is very important. But Christensen is talking about a very specific situation: where a new technology has appeared that is different and not yet good enough to replace the old one. If you ask your customers what they think of the new technology, they will say &#8220;not good enough.&#8221; As a result, you might choose to ignore this new technology and focus on making gradual improvements to your old one. But that new technology is gradually improving, too. And suddenly, almost overnight, the new technology will cross some threshold into the realm of &#8220;good enough,&#8221; and all the customers of the old technology will suddenly jump ship for this new &#8220;disruptive technology&#8221; that is faster, better, and cheaper.</p>
<p class="indent">We&#8217;ve seen this in videogames many times. Makers of retail PC games did not take console gaming seriously for years&#8212;consoles just weren&#8217;t &#8220;good enough.&#8221; And then, suddenly, they were. And in less than a year, PC games went from being mainstream to being fringe. Motion controllers have been around for twenty years, but they were always considered too expensive or not reliable enough. As a result, most console manufacturers didn&#8217;t take them seriously. But then, after a series of gradual improvements and innovations, Nintendo released the Wiimote, with a clever motion controller that was &#8220;good enough,&#8221; and nearly took over the console market in the process. And right now, technologies like speech recognition, artificial intelligence (AI), brainwave sensing, and many more are ignored because they aren&#8217;t &#8220;good enough&#8221; for games. If you can manage to design games for technologies that are on the verge of &#8220;breaking through,&#8221; you can ride a wave of success that no one else saw coming&#8212;provided, of course, the technologies are foundational!</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec29_6"><span id="p506" aria-label=" page 506. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="pd_orange">The Law of Divergence</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">One repeated error that comes up again and again when people try to predict the future of technology: they assume that technologies will converge and unify. For example, many people predict that one day soon you&#8217;ll have one device in your living room that will play all your videos, music, and games. But think about how many remote controls are in your living room. Three or four, yes? Of course, you used to have just one&#8212;but as technology advanced, the number of devices multiplied. Why? Because it always does. Different technologies advance at different rates, and so we have different devices, because if they were all glued together into one big TV/computer/music/videoplayer/game console, you&#8217;d have to replace the whole thing every time there was one new feature. Instead, technologies constantly diverge as they evolve, like fish in the Galapagos islands. By having them as separate devices, you can mix and match and be ready for whatever shows up next. This will surely continue for videogames as we continue to develop more and more interesting new input and output systems for playing games.</p>
<p class="indent">There is an exception to the law of divergence, though: the pocket. Things we carry in our pockets (such as Swiss army knives and smartphones) tend to have a convergence of technologies, for convenience. The pocket exception is important for games, as well, but it is wise to remember it is just that: an exception.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3">
<h2 class="h3" id="sec29_7"><span class="pd_orange">The Singularity</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">We&#8217;ve all noticed how technology presses into our lives ever more strongly with each passing year. Without a doubt, the pace of technological progress is not just increasing, it is accelerating. As it does so, it becomes more and more difficult to predict the future. A thousand years ago, you could make a pretty good guess at what daily life would be like one hundred years in the future. Now it is difficult for us to make guesses at life just ten years in the future. Some people theorize that as technology continues to accelerate, soon we won&#8217;t be able to make predictions about what life will be like a year away, a month away, or eventually in the next ten minutes. The moment where technological progress is so fast that we can make no predictions whatsoever is called the singularity, and some predict it will arrive in our lifetimes.</p>
<p class="indent">This may sound farfetched, but there is no doubt that the rapid pace of technological change is good news for game designers, since new technologies mean new game possibilities. Further, it is not out of the question that our techniques of developing engaging virtual worlds, now considered merely an amusing pastime, may blossom into something central to the nature of human experience if the technologies for creating and experiencing virtual realities take sudden leaps forward.</p>
<p class="indent">Technology is the medium of your game and one of the four cornerstones of game design. Use this handy lens to examine your technological choices carefully.</p>

<p class="noindent">One effect of rapid technological change is that people get so caught up trying to understand the new technology that is here now; they stop thinking about what is coming next. Weary with so much innovation, they have given up on trying to predict the future, believing it to be too difficult. This is to your tremendous advantage&#8212;for a great deal of what is to come can be guessed at, if you sit down and carefully think it through. And what a benefit to you, the designer, if you can guess right! You&#8217;ll be able to prepare for trends and developments that no one else saw coming, except you, because you used logic and reason to see what was coming before it arrived. You won&#8217;t always get it right, of course, but each time you <span id="p508" aria-label=" page 508. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>get it wrong, you&#8217;ll realize why, and it will make you a better predictor next time. The very act of trying to predict the future can change the way you see the world. Give it a try with some of these examples:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">What will living room gaming be like in four years? How will it differ from what we have now?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">How about eight years from now?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Two years from now, what percentage of games will be downloaded, as opposed to being loaded from a disk or cartridge? Why? How about five years from now?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Will VR ever become the dominant gaming platform? Why or why not?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">What will the next trend in online games be? Why?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">What will small game studios be working on four years from now?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">What will large game studios be working on four years from now?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">How will sports games be different four years from now?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">How will first-person shooters be different four years from now?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">How will the genre of your choice be different four years from now?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">What new genres might appear in the next four years? Why?</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Answering questions like this can be tough. It helps if you discuss them with others. As you do so, you&#8217;ll find yourself plotting out things that are likely to happen and using those certainties as a scaffolding for your less confident predictions. It is not the predictions themselves that will be valuable to you, but rather the scaffolding that you create to make them. You will develop not just an instinct about technology but also how it fits with the human mind, for knowledge of both is necessary to predict the future, or as I like to say, technology&#8201;+&#8201;psychology&#8201;=&#8201;destiny. Further, attempts to predict the future often force you to examine historical trends, which give you insights that you can really use, and that are often correct. I&#8217;ve created a YouTube channel that you can find at <a class="nounder" href="http://crystalballsociety.com">http://crystalballsociety.com</a> where I collect videos of myself and others making concrete predictions about the future. I&#8217;d love to include yours! With practice, trying to predict the future of technology won&#8217;t seem like such hard work and will start to become habitual. And who doesn&#8217;t want to see into the future?</p>

<p class="noindent">If you would like to know the future of a particular game technology, ask yourself these questions, and make your answers as concrete as possible:</p>

<p class="indent">Before we move on, we should take a moment to consider why it is that people get so excited about technology. Certainly, as we discussed in <a class="nounder" href="C19_chapter16.xhtml#chapter16">Chapter 16</a>: <a class="nounder" href="C19_chapter16.xhtml#chapter16"><i>Interest Curves</i></a>, the potential for dramatic change that technology offers is going to be naturally interesting. But there is something more. There is something that technology offers that every human being who ever lived has sought: utopia. A desire for utopia is something we all have in common. The dream of a perfect world is the driving force behind so much: schools, churches, governments, laws, inventions, Internet start-ups, health-care plans, revolutions, nonprofit organizations, books, art, and, yes, video games. In some ways especially video games. After all, what is it that we promise? Not just games, but whole worlds&#8212;worlds that are more exciting, more beautiful, and more just than this one. Viewed this way, it is no wonder there is such a Hype Cycle around what we create. Players expect nothing less than for us to lead them to utopia. And when they stop caring about our new games and systems, as sometimes happens, it means they have lost their faith in us&#8212;that they no longer believe we know the way.</p>
<p class="indent">This is why it is of the utmost importance that when you choose new technologies, you choose the ones most likely to lead to a better world. At this point in time, I believe that these five types of technology have the best chance of fulfilling that dream.</p>
<ol class="list-order">
<li><p class="list"><b>Magical interfaces</b>: Intuitive interfaces are not enough; players want interfaces that feel magical. The success of the iPhone and iPad was largely centered on that magical feeling. One can debate the overall value of the Microsoft Kinect system, but no one can debate the millions of units that were purchased by players eager to try out a magical new interface.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Fair payment</b>: The models for how videogames are purchased have changed radically over the last decade, as many experiments have taken place. And still, players don&#8217;t find the systems we have for selling games to feel entirely fair. If you can come up with a system that players find fair, while still sustaining your ability to create great games, players and developers alike will follow your lead.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span id="p510" aria-label=" page 510. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><b>Less A, more I</b>: That is, AI that feels less artificial. One of the broken promises of the computer revolution was computers that would think and communicate like humans. We&#8217;re still a long way off&#8212;but the technology that will get there first will be gaming, because our AI doesn&#8217;t have to be perfect, but it just has to be interesting. We are well poised for a decade of fascinating game AI developments that will capture the world&#8217;s imagination.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Family and friends</b>: As we&#8217;ve said, people generally don&#8217;t play games to be alone. They&#8217;d usually rather play them with family and friends. And while we have some games that work well for some relationships, there are so many opportunities that have been missed. Where are the games that a husband and wife will delightedly play together, night after night? Where are the games that put a whole family on a quest? Where are the games that help children connect with their remote grandparents? The success of games like Words with Friends begins to point the way, but so many opportunities remain.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Transformation</b>: People play games for light amusement, yes&#8212;but what if you could make games that help people change into the people they truly want to be, transforming them mentally, physically, and spiritually? This is hard to deliver, but there is great demand for it, as the success of things like the Wii Fit and Lumosity has shown. If you choose technologies that help people improve themselves, you will undoubtedly be leading us to a better world.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">The notion of utopia through games is an important, though counterintuitive, idea. Carry this lens like a torch to help you light the way.</p>

<h2 class="box-title"><a href="C02b_tol.xhtml#rbox106"><span class="pd_whitez">#106 The Lens of Utopia</span></a></h2>
<p class="noindent">To be sure you are headed toward a better world, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">Am I creating something that feels magical?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Do people get excited just hearing about what I am making? Why or why not?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Does my game advance the state of the art in a meaningful way?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Does my game make the world a better place?</p></li>
