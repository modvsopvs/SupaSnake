<p class="noindent">At the start of this book, we talked about how listening is the most important skill for a game designer. And through the book, we examined facets of listening to your audience, to your game, to your team, and to your client.</p>
<p class="indent">But now, it is time to talk about the most important type of listening&#8212;listening to yourself. You might think it is easy to listen to yourself. But our subconscious mind holds many secrets. We often do things, and we don&#8217;t know why. Why, for instance, is game design so very important to you? Do you know? You might think that the time for this kind of self-reflection can come later. But it can&#8217;t, because life is very short. In a blink, you will look up and realize you don&#8217;t have any time left. For time destroys everything and takes everything away. Like Poe&#8217;s raven, it mocks you, cackling &#8220;nevermore&#8221; as it glides into the night. You can&#8217;t stop it. Your only hope is to do your important work now while you still can. You must run like death is behind you because death is behind you. Quick&#8212;take this lens so you don&#8217;t forget.</p>

<p class="noindent">To remember to only work on what is important, ask yourself this question:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">Is making this game worth my time?</p></li>

<p class="indent">But what is that important work? How can you know? This is why you must learn to listen to yourself. There is some important purpose that is hidden inside you, and you must find out what it is. Surely, there is some reason you are going through all the trouble of trying to design great games. Maybe it is because you can see something in your mind&#8217;s eye that you feel will change someone&#8217;s life. Maybe it is because of something wonderful that you experienced once, and you want to share it with the world. Maybe something terrible happened to someone you loved, <span id="p575" aria-label=" page 575. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and you want to be sure it never happens again, to anyone. No one can know this purpose but you, and no one needs to know it but you. We spoke about how much more powerful your game will be if you know its theme, but do you know your own personal theme? You must figure it out as soon as possible, for once you know it, you will undergo an important creative change: your conscious and subconscious motivations will be united, and your work will gain a passion, a focus, and an intensity that cannot possibly be greater.</p>
<p class="indent">To help you find your true motivation, take this final lens.</p>
