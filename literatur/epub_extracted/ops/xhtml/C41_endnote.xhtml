<p class="fn-text"><a href="C05_chapter2.xhtml#p13">Page 13</a>&#8212;&#8220;Psychology, Anthropology, and Design.&#8221; I was surprised to find this triad reinforced by other sources. George Santayana, in <i>The Sense of Beauty</i>, forms a similar triad of psychologist, anthropologist, and artist. Marc Prensky, in <i>Digital Game Based Learning</i>, talks about the three paths to knowledge: &#8220;The analytical path, where philosophers reflect, mediate, and make sense of objects and events; the empirical path, where scientists manipulate variables and conduct controlled experiments to validate reliable principles; and the pragmatic path where practitioners struggle with real-world challenges and come up with strategies for effective and efficient performance.&#8221; Analytical corresponds to anthropology, empirical to psychology, and pragmatic to design.</p>

<p class="fn-text"><a href="C05_chapter2.xhtml#p16">Page 16</a>&#8212;&#8220;&#8230;we can confidently trust our feelings and instincts when making conclusions about the quality of an experience.&#8221; A quote from G.K. Chesterton is relevant here: &#8220;A man can understand astronomy only by being an astronomer; he can understand entomology only by being an entomologist (or, perhaps, an insect); but he can understand a great deal of anthropology merely by being a man. He is himself the animal which he studies. Hence arises the fact which strikes the eye everywhere in the records of ethnology and folk-lore - the fact that the same frigid and detached spirit which leads to success in the study of astronomy or botany leads to disaster in the study of mythology or human origins. It is necessary to cease to be a man in order to do justice to a microbe; it is not necessary to cease to be a man in order to do justice to men. That same suppression of sympathies, that same waving away of intuitions or guess-work which make a man preternaturally clever in dealing with the stomach of a spider, will make him preternaturally stupid in dealing with the heart of man.&#8221; (From &#8220;Science and the Savages&#8221; by G.K. Chesterton, in <i>Heretics</i>.)</p>

Did the Pixar team choose to make Toy Story because a story about plastic toys would be the best story anyone could tell? No&#8212;they chose it because their technology at the time prevented them from telling compelling stories about human beings. Plastic toys, though, they could render. So, in that case, technology came first, but then story was used to support it, and as with all great things, the different elements all supported each other.</p>
