<p class="noindent">It is easy, when developing a game, to fantasize about the player experience and to imagine how great it will be. Playtesting is necessary to serve as a wakeup call and force you to solve the ugly problems you&#8217;ve been putting off. Before we get too deep into this discussion, I want to draw the distinction between four different types of testing (focus groups, QA testing, usability testing, and playtesting):</p>
<ol class="list-order">
<li><p class="list"><b>Focus groups</b>: This is a term that often causes professional designers to wince. It refers to sessions where potential players are interviewed about their likes and dislikes, often in an attempt to determine whether they like a game idea that a company is considering. Focus groups can be quite useful in the right context (particularly when deciding the relative priority of well-defined features), but they have a bad name because they are so often poorly run and manipulated to kill ideas that management is afraid of.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>QA testing</b>: QA is &#8220;quality assurance.&#8221; This testing has nothing to do with how enjoyable the game is and everything to do with looking for bugs.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Usability testing</b>: This is all about determining whether your interface and systems are intuitive and easy to use. Both of these are necessary for an enjoyable game, but they are not enough. Keep this in mind when someone suggests bringing in a usability expert to make your game more fun.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Playtesting</b>: Separate from the previous three, playtesting is all about getting people to come play your game to see if it engenders the experience for which it <span id="p481" aria-label=" page 481. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>was designed. And while the other three types of testing are useful and important, in this chapter, we will focus only on the type of testing designers care about the most: playtesting.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section class="level3">
<h2 class="h3" id="sec28_2"><span class="pd_orange">My Terrible Secret</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">I&#8217;m going to admit something now that is profoundly embarrassing. For years, I have tried to pretend that it isn&#8217;t the case, but there is no getting around it. I don&#8217;t like talking about it, because it makes me a hypocrite and calls my qualifications as a game designer into serious question.</p>
<p class="indent">However, my goal with this book is to help lay out how game design really is, not some idyllic dream version of how it should be. So, here it goes. Please try not to judge me too harshly.</p>
<p class="indent">I hate playtesting.</p>
<p class="indent">Does playtesting find problems early, while there is still time to fix them? Yes. Does playtesting build the team&#8217;s confidence that they are making the right game for the right audience? Yes. Is playtesting essential to making a good game? Yes. Does playtesting fill me with a terror so intense that I can&#8217;t even think straight? Yes, yes, yes!</p>
<p class="indent">It&#8217;s completely humiliating. I know that playtesting is good for my game, not just good, but necessary. But when it comes to actually doing the playtesting, I find every excuse possible to avoid it. First, I delay getting the playtesting organized. When it eventually gets organized, I make excuses why I can&#8217;t be there. When I actually am there, I find reasons not to observe it directly, getting distracted with anything else that might be nearby. I&#8217;m well aware of these tendencies, and I fight them tooth and nail, but still, my fear of playtesting remains.</p>
<p class="indent">Why? What am I so afraid of? It&#8217;s simple. I&#8217;m afraid that people won&#8217;t like my game. I should be above that, I know. But I&#8217;m not. When you make a game, you try to put everything you can into it: heart, soul, dreams, blood, sweat, and tears. A game you work hard on becomes a little piece of yourself. To have people engage with that and then reject it, well, it hurts. A lot. And don&#8217;t kid yourself&#8212;it is going to happen.</p>
<p class="indent">Having people hate your work is probably one of the most painful parts of being a game designer. And playtesting is like an engraved invitation that reads:</p>
<p class="center"><i>You are cordially invited</i><br/><i>to tell me why I suck</i><br/><i>Bring a friend &#8212; Refreshments Served</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Does playtesting have to be so uncomfortable? It does. The whole point of playtesting is to make clear to you that some of the decisions you were completely <span id="p482" aria-label=" page 482. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>comfortable with are completely wrong. You need to find these things out as soon as possible, while there is still time to do something about them.</p>
<p class="indent">Maybe playtesting comes naturally to you. Maybe you have no fear of people ridiculing your work. If so, congratulations! Your objective viewpoint will be a great boon to you during playtesting sessions. But if you fear and loathe these sessions, like I do, there is only one thing to do: get over it. People are either going to like your game or they aren&#8217;t. If they do, great. If they don&#8217;t, also great! You have a chance to ask them why they don&#8217;t like it, so you can fix it. Let go of your fears and embrace playtesting for what it is: a wonderful opportunity to make your game better.</p>
<p class="indent">Every playtest is defined by six key questions: Why, who, when, where, what, and how?</p>
</section>
<section class="level3">
<h2 class="h3" id="sec28_3"><span class="pd_orange">Playtest Question the First: Why?</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Do you remember how, in <a class="nounder" href="C11_chapter8.xhtml#chapter8">Chapter 8</a>: <a class="nounder" href="C11_chapter8.xhtml#chapter8"><i>Iteration</i></a>, we discussed how every prototype is designed to answer a question? A playtest is a kind of prototype&#8212;not a prototype of the game, but a prototype of the game experience (which is what we care about the most!). If you don&#8217;t enter into your playtest with specific goals in mind, you stand a good chance of wasting your time. The more specific the questions you have when you organize the playtest, the more you will get out of it.</p>
<p class="indent">There are millions of questions you might want your playtest to answer. The most obvious one&#8212;&#8220;Is my game fun?&#8221;&#8212;is not enough. Generally, you want your questions to be as specific as possible. The examples are as follows&#8212;some general, some specific:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">Do men and women play my game differently?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Do kids like my game better than adults?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Do players understand how to play?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Do players want to play a second time? A third time? A twentieth time? Why?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Do players feel the game is fair?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Are players ever bored?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Are players ever confused?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Are players ever frustrated?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Are there any dominant strategies or loopholes?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Does the game have hidden bugs?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">What strategies do players find on their own?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Which parts of the game are the most fun?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Which parts of the game are the least fun?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Should the &#8220;A&#8221; button or &#8220;B&#8221; button be used for jumping?</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span id="p483" aria-label=" page 483. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Is level three too long?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Is the asparagus puzzle too hard?</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">These are just a few ideas to get you thinking. I often find that using the lenses throughout this book is a great way to come up with good playtesting questions.</p>
<p class="indent">Preparing a list of the questions you would like the playtest to answer is a great first step to planning a playtest, because until you have determined the &#8220;why,&#8221; as in &#8220;why are we having this playtest?&#8221; there is no way to answer the who, where, what, and how.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3">
<h2 class="h3" id="sec28_4"><span class="pd_orange">Playtest Question the Second: Who?</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Once you know why you are having a playtest, you can decide who you should be testing. And who you pick is entirely determined by what you would like to learn. Most likely, you want to pick people who are in your target demographic. But even then, there are choices. Here are some common ones:</p>
<ol class="list-order">
<li><p class="list"><b>Developers</b>: The first people who will get a chance to try your game are the developers, so I&#8217;m listing them first.</p>
<ul class="list-alpha-lower">
<li><p class="list-item">Pros: The developers are right there! They can play the game a lot, and for a long time, and give lots of meaningful, thoughtful feedback. Also, you don&#8217;t need to worry about them filling out nondisclosure agreements (NDAs), since they already know all the confidential information about the game.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item">Cons: The developers are too close to the game&#8212;closer than any real player ever will be&#8212;and this will distort their opinions about the game. Some &#8220;design experts&#8221; will tell you that it is dangerous to playtest with people who work on the game and that you shouldn&#8217;t do it. This extreme position means, though, that you could miss out on some valuable insights. It is better to playtest the developers but take what they say with a grain of salt.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Friends</b>: The next people to try the game will most likely be friends and families of the developers.</p>
<ul class="list-alpha-lower">
<li><p class="list-item">Pros: Friends and families are highly available and comfortable talking to you. If they think of a good idea after the playtest is over, you&#8217;ll probably still get to hear it.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item">Cons: Your friends and family don&#8217;t want to hurt your feelings&#8212;after all, they have to deal with you on a regular basis. This might cause them to bend the truth when they don&#8217;t like something. Also, since they like you already, they are going to be predisposed to like the game&#8212;they will be trying to like it, which isn&#8217;t what will happen in the real world.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p class="list"><span id="p484" aria-label=" page 484. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><b>Expert gamers</b>: Every genre has its &#8220;experts&#8221;&#8212;hardcore players who have played every variety of the type of game you are making. These individuals love coming to playtest games still in progress, because it gives their &#8220;expert&#8221; credentials a boost!</p>
<ul class="list-alpha-lower">
<li><p class="list-item">Pros: Having played many, if not all, of the games that are similar to the one you are making, these expert gamers can give you a detailed account, using technical terminology and specific examples, of how your game compares to games that are like it.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item">Cons: Just as only a small percentage of the eating public are gourmands, only a small percentage of the gaming public are, uh, &#8220;ludophiles.&#8221; Expert gamers are often more jaded and demand more complex and difficult gameplay challenges than the average gamer. Many a game has been spoiled by overtuning it for the elite tastes of a niche audience of hardcore enthusiasts. <i>The Sims Online</i>, which was expected to be a huge success, ended up as a crashing failure. One reason seems to have been that it was overtuned for the most hardcore players, who were more excited about creating content than experiencing it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Tissue testers</b>: Ideal testing conditions often include people who have never seen your game before. The industry likes to call them &#8220;fresh meat&#8221; or &#8220;tissue testers&#8221; (a reference to the fact that, like a Kleenex tissue, they can only be used once).</p>
<ul class="list-alpha-lower">
<li><p class="list-item">Pros: People who have never seen your game before see it with fresh eyes and will notice the things that you have gotten used to. For testing that tries to determine usability questions, communication questions, or questions of &#8220;initial appeal,&#8221; these testers can be very valuable.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item">Cons: Games are generally played multiple times, over many sessions. If you only test your game with &#8220;tissue testers,&#8221; you run the risk of making a game that has a strong first-time appeal but gets boring after multiple plays.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">Again, who you test with will depend entirely on what you are trying to learn. Matching the testers to the questions you are trying to answer is the only way to get meaningful results. Nearly every game will test with some combination of the aforementioned testers sometime during the design process&#8212;the key is having the right testers at the right times to answer the most questions as thoroughly as possible.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3">
<h2 class="h3" id="sec28_5"><span class="pd_orange">Playtest Question the Third: When?</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">It is easy to come up with excuses not to playtest&#8230; and the main excuse is, &#8220;the game isn&#8217;t ready yet.&#8221; But the sooner you playtest, the sooner you will know whether your game is on the right track. You can playtest your game no matter what stage it&#8217;s at:</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="p485" aria-label=" page 485. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><b>Pre-Idea</b>: Get a focus group together of the kind of people you&#8217;d like to make a game for. &#8220;What kind of games do you like? What kind of games would you like to see?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Initial Concept</b>: &#8220;We&#8217;re thinking we might make a game that works like this&#8230; what do you think?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Paper Prototype</b>: As we discussed in <a class="nounder" href="C11_chapter8.xhtml#chapter8">Chapter 8</a>: <a class="nounder" href="C11_chapter8.xhtml#chapter8"><i>Iteration</i></a>, paper prototyping can be a very efficient way to test out a new game concept. But don&#8217;t leave all the paper game fun for the developers&#8212;invite playtesters in to see how they like your just-barely-playable game.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Whitebox Prototype</b>: Great! You coded up your game, but it doesn&#8217;t really have any art in it yet. That&#8217;s okay! Give players the caveats, and then get them playing it. People give more honest feedback about uglier games anyway!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Working Prototype</b>: Awesome! You have something like a functional game! Keep the playtesting going as late into the process as you can.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Finished, Shipped Game</b>: The game is done&#8230; too late to playtest it now, right? Wrong! Nowadays it&#8217;s all about &#8220;Games as a Service&#8221;&#8212;players expect fixes and new features even long after your game has shipped. In that way, shipping your game is like the biggest playtest of all!</p>
<p class="indent">Hopefully you are getting the message that you can playtest your game at any time during the development process. But&#8230; how often should you realistically have a playtest? Game designer and playtesting wizard Shawn Patton has a simple answer to that question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="quote"><i>WUBALEW</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">And of course, WUBALEW stands for <i>When Useful, But At Least Every Week</i>. That might sound like a lot, but making it your habit to playtest your game weekly ensures that you&#8217;ll never go too far without getting real feedback about your game. And keeping it on a regular schedule makes it routine. Once you&#8217;ve been doing weekly playtesting for a while, you&#8217;ll wonder how you ever got by without it.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3">
<h2 class="h3" id="sec28_6"><span class="pd_orange">Playtest Question the Fourth: Where?</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Just as much depends on the venue of your game (see <a class="nounder" href="C06_chapter3.xhtml#chapter3">Chapter 3</a>: <a class="nounder" href="C06_chapter3.xhtml#chapter3"><i>Venue</i></a>), much depends on the venue of your playtest. Here are some different options:</p>
<ol class="list-order">
<li><p class="list"><b>In your studio</b> (or whatever you call the place you actually make the games)</p>
<ul class="list-alpha-lower">
<li><p class="list-item">Pros: The developers are all there. You are there. The game is there! So, testing in your studio can be superconvenient for you. Also, it gives everyone on the team a chance to observe the game being played by real people.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item">Cons: The playtesters you bring in might not feel completely comfortable. They will be in strange surroundings, and unless they have some kind of private room, they are likely to be afraid to have fun while others are working. <span id="p486" aria-label=" page 486. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>If you host a playtest in your studio, you should go out of your way to make it as comfortable as possible. The last thing you want is playtesters who are afraid to make noise, have fun, and speak their minds. Asking the testers to bring friends helps.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>In a playtesting lab</b>: Some (though, actually, surprisingly few) large game companies have special labs set aside for playtesting. Also, some third-party companies will playtest your game for you in special labs designed for the purpose.</p>
<ul class="list-alpha-lower">
<li><p class="list-item">Pros: The lab is designed for playtesting! It probably has all the things you could wish for: one-way mirrors, cameras on the playtesters, playtesting experts to ask the right questions and take detailed notes, and maybe even a carefully selected group of the right testers!</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item">Cons: This kind of thing is usually very expensive. But if you can afford it, it may well be worth the investment.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>At some public venue</b>: Could be a shopping mall, an event on a college campus, a games fest like PAX or Indiecade, or a table on a street corner.</p>
<ul class="list-alpha-lower">
<li><p class="list-item">Pros: It usually doesn&#8217;t cost much, and you will get a chance to get many testers, if you find the right venue. When Schell Games needed to test its <i>Daniel Tiger&#8217;s Neighborhood</i> games, we worked out an arrangement with the Pittsburgh Children&#8217;s Museum to test periodically right in the museum, which provided an endless supply of 3&#8211;5-year-old children and their parents&#8212;precisely what we needed.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item">Cons: You may have a hard time finding the &#8220;right&#8221; testers, that is, the ones in your demographic. Also, if there are other things going on in this venue, testers may be distracted, not giving you their full attention.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>At the playtester&#8217;s home</b>: After people buy your game, they are going to play it in their homes&#8212;why not let them play it there now?</p>
<ul class="list-alpha-lower">
<li><p class="list-item">Pros: You have a good chance of seeing your game played in its natural habitat, under real conditions. Your testers are likely to have their friends over, and you stand a chance of seeing real social interaction through your game.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item">Cons: Your playtest might be kind of limited. Probably only one or two designers can be there to observe, and you may only be able to test with a small number of people during a given session. You may also need to lug special hardware with you or at least spend time configuring machines to run your prototype software.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Online</b>: Why restrict your playtesting to the confines of the physical universe?</p>
<ul class="list-alpha-lower">
<li><p class="list-item">Pros: Lots of people will be able to test your game on machines with many different configurations. If the questions you need to answer involve stress testing your game or learning about massively multiplayer play, this may be your best option.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item"><span id="p487" aria-label=" page 487. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Cons: Quantity of playtesting comes at the price of quality of playtesting. Though many people may be playing, you won&#8217;t get the same level of insight when you aren&#8217;t in the same room with the testers. Also, if you are trying to keep your game a secret, this may be hard to do when you make it available for download. Also, first impressions are important, so you need to restrict your player base if you are going to put an unfinished version online. Fortunately, some online venues (such as Steam) are creating safe spaces to put beta versions of your game, to help control player expectations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">Where exactly you choose to test depends completely on the questions your test is trying to answer. Choose your test location with your important &#8220;why?&#8221; questions in mind. Often, the simplest ideas are best&#8212;consider this story from designer Curt Bererton:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="quote"><i>One thing that we did that I found super effective in one of our alphas (for a Facebook game) was to put a text box about 2&#8211;3 lines of text in height below the game. All the text box said was &#8220;tell us how to make our game better,&#8221; and you could send one message per session after which the box would go away. Emails would go to a mailing list to which anyone on the team could sign up to see what players were putting in there.</i></p>
<p class="quote1"><i>This simple text field worked remarkably well during alpha and beta, and we even kept it in production for an adjustable small percentage of players (and all paying users) such that we&#8217;d get around 30 messages per day, which we could browse when we wished. You&#8217;d think you would get a lot more people swearing or something, but pretty much everything was very high quality feedback. We found a ton of bugs, user experience issues, as well as just great ideas. We would look especially closely whenever we did a push of a new version. As a side note, if you send some summary player state data along (where they are in the tutorial or game progression) along with platform specs (version, memory etc.) it helps with bug hunting in addition to keeping your finger on the pulse of your community.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<section class="level3">
<h2 class="h3" id="sec28_7"><span class="pd_orange">Playtest Question the Fifth: What?</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">By &#8220;What?&#8221; I mean &#8220;What will you look for in your playtest?&#8221; There are two types of things to look for.</p>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec28_7_1"><span class="pd_orange">The First What: Things You Know You Are Looking For</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">These come from the questions in your &#8220;why?&#8221; list. Hopefully, you are going to design your playtest so that you can look for answers to these questions (that&#8217;s why you listed them!). As you plan your test, make sure that you have a way to get some kind <span id="p488" aria-label=" page 488. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>of answer to every question on your list. If there are parts of your game that aren&#8217;t relevant to these questions, consider making a special version of the game that skips these parts to save time. If the questions can&#8217;t all be answered by a single test, consider making several minitests that will cover the span of things you need to find out.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec28_7_2"><span class="pd_orange">The Second What: Things You Don&#8217;t Know You Are Looking For</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Anyone can find things they know they are looking for&#8212;but only a truly observant designer, who has learned to listen deeply to players, can find the things they don&#8217;t know they are looking for. The key is to keep your eyes open for surprises. To be surprised at a playtest, you must already have ideas about what will happen: Players will attack level two a certain way, they will get excited at the start of level three, etc. Whenever anything out of the ordinary happens, good or bad, be ready to jump on it, and find a way to understand it. Do girls like your game more than boys, when you expected the opposite? Does your villain make people laugh when you thought he would be scary? Are players intrigued by something you thought was unimportant? Are they debating strategies you never considered? Find out why! Even if you weren&#8217;t testing for these things, take advantage of this opportunity to learn the truth about everything you thought you already understood. The insight that comes from understanding these surprises is the sweetest fruit that grows on the playtesting tree.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="level3">
<h2 class="h3" id="sec28_8"><span class="pd_orange">Playtest Question the Sixth: How?</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">So you&#8217;ve figured out why you want to have a playtest, who you will observe, where you will hold it, and even what you are going to look for. Those are great preliminaries, but the rubber doesn&#8217;t meet the road until you decide how you are going to go about it.</p>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec28_8_1"><span class="pd_orange">Should You Even Be There?</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">There is a school of thought that believes it is dangerous to have the developers of a game present when it is tested. The danger is that their emotional investment in the game will cause them to encourage the players to overlook flaws and &#8220;infect&#8221; the players with an insider&#8217;s viewpoint. And this danger is very real. If you cannot stay objective during the playtest and properly police your behavior so that playtesters can remain &#8220;pure,&#8221; you definitely should not be there. If that is the case, it is a shame, because there is so much more you will learn by being present in person at a playtest than you can get from just reading survey data or watching recorded videos. So, though some design theorists might disagree, my advice is to find ways to restrain these corrupting impulses so you can be there in person.</p>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec28_8_2"><span id="p489" aria-label=" page 489. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="pd_orange">What Do You Tell Them Up Front?</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">For some tests, you won&#8217;t tell the players anything at all&#8212;you&#8217;ll let the game speak for itself, particularly if you want to see if they can figure it out by themselves. But for the majority of playtests, you will need to tell players something to get them started. Use extreme caution when you do so&#8212;a few misplaced words right before play begins can spoil the entire test. If, for example, you tell players that their goal is to defeat the evil Chronos, some players might start looking for him right away and, in doing so, miss out on important details they would have found if you hadn&#8217;t said that. For this reason, you should take careful note of what you say to testers at the beginning, in case it has unexpected consequences. It can be a good idea to write it down ahead of time, so you can be sure you have prepped all the testers the same way.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, you may find, over the course of several tests, a need to change your introductory speech to clarify certain things. And here is one of the great side benefits of playtesting. When you run multiple playtest sessions in sequence, you will find yourself gradually tuning the instructions you give to the players, trimming a word here, and adding a phrase there, until you have a speech that is very clear and very efficient. Write this down! This speech can become the foundation of your in-game tutorial. Many game tutorials are terrible&#8212;the ones created by this method are likely to have an aura of excellence about them. Having an in-game tutorial that really makes players feel welcome and cared for is a great first impression for your game to make.</p>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec28_8_3"><span class="pd_orange">Where Do You Look?</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Most people who attend a playtest tend to look where the player looks. If it is a videogame, this means at the screen. This makes sense, because this way you see what the player sees. But it isn&#8217;t where I look. I spend most of my time during a playtest looking at the players&#8217; faces. Sure, I steal quick glances at the screen for context, but mostly, I watch faces, because I don&#8217;t just want to see what the players are doing, but how they feel when they are doing it. Their facial expressions give a wealth of data about the game that will never come out in postgame interviews or survey questions.</p>
<p class="indent">I learned to do this when I was a street performer. When you do street shows, the only money you get is what you collect by passing the hat at the end. So, if you want to have dinner that night, it becomes crucial to ensure the crowd you&#8217;ve scared up stays entertained. With practice, I soon found I could &#8220;read&#8221; the emotions of a crowd quickly and would tune my performance appropriately&#8212;stretching out parts they enjoyed and moving quickly through parts that bored them. I was quite surprised, when I started making videogames, to find myself reading the emotions of the players as they played and determining how the game should change to improve the quality of the players&#8217; emotional experiences. This is something that we are all equipped to do&#8212;it just has to be practiced.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="p490" aria-label=" page 490. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Of course, it would be best if our eyes could be everywhere at once: on the game, on the players&#8217; faces, and even on their hands, to see if they are using the controls as we would expect. And with modern video technology, you can see it all! Getting a few different cameras set up to feed to a single split-screen image can be a great way to record the game, face, and hands at the same time, so you can go back later and see how all three of these things interrelate.</p>

<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec28_8_4"><span class="pd_orange">What Other Data Should You Collect During Play?</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Watching with your own eyes and recording video of a play session can give you a lot of useful information, but there is other information you can gather as well. With a little planning, you can find ways to keep logs of important game events during each play session. If your game is digital, you can log all this automatically, but if your game is not, you can just make careful notes when these important events occur. What constitutes an &#8220;important event&#8221; will vary from game to game of course. Here are some examples of data you might want to collect:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">How long did players spend in the character creator?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">How many hits did it take to defeat the villain?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">What was the average player score?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Which weapons were used the most?</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">The more your game can collect these data automatically, the more useful the data will be to you. In the past few years, it has become a necessity for anyone creating an MMO or free to play game to have a rigorous system of analytics in place accompanied by a content management system so that a continuous system of tuning and testing can be taking place in perpetuity. This new kind of &#8220;quantitative design&#8221; has its dangers&#8212;it can lead to dull designs and fear of trusting your own instincts as a designer, but if you can overcome that, it is a subtle art that gives you new opportunities to understand player behavior.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec28_8_5"><span class="pd_orange">Will I Disturb the Players Midgame?</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">This is a delicate question. When you disturb players midgame, perhaps to ask them a question about what they are doing, you run the risk of interfering with their natural play patterns. On the other hand, asking the right question at the right moment may give you an insight you would not have had any other way. You might argue that it is best to just make a note of the question you have in mind and ask the player about it when the play session is over. But by that time, the player is in a different state of mind and may have no recollection of what you are talking about. <span id="p491" aria-label=" page 491. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>It is a difficult trade-off. Most designers seem to favor only interrupting when the player is doing something truly surprising that the designer does not understand.</p>
<p class="indent">Experts in human computer interaction often recommend the &#8220;think-aloud protocol&#8221; to learn the decision-making process of people interacting with software products. The idea is that you encourage the person using the software to verbalize all their internal thoughts into a kind of stream-of-consciousness ramble. With a game, this might sound something like: &#8220;Let&#8217;s see&#8230; I&#8217;m supposed to find bananas, but I don&#8217;t see any&#8230; I wonder what&#8217;s behind that log&#8230; Yow! Bad guys! Ouch! Take that! Okay&#8230; Hey, is that a banana up on that hill?&#8221; etc. With games, this can be tricky. For some people, the act of speaking their thoughts changes the way they behave&#8212;often their behavior becomes more thoughtful and careful, so the think-aloud protocol can taint play patterns. Other people become paralyzed trying to play and talk at the same time, and when the gameplay gets stressful, they often stop talking altogether, which is frustrating, because these stressful moments are often when a designer needs the most insight into what a player is thinking. However, for some players, thinking aloud comes very naturally and can provide very useful information&#8212;the trick is identifying these players or training repeat playtesters to do it well. I have seen well-meaning interaction experts completely ruin playtests by constantly peppering players with questions during play in an attempt to elicit think-aloud. When and whether to use this technique is something you will need to decide for yourself.</p>

<section class="level3">
<h2 class="h3" id="sec28_9"><span class="pd_orange">What Data Will I Collect after the Play Session?</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">You will gain a tremendous amount of information just by observing players interacting with your game. But you can gain even more with meaningful follow-up questions with interviews and surveys. But which should you choose?</p>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec28_9_1"><span class="pd_orange">Surveys</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Surveys are a great way to have players answer straightforward questions about your game that are easily quantified. Here are some tips for getting the most out of surveys:</p>
<ol class="list-order">
<li><p class="list"><b>Use pictures whenever possible</b>, when asking about game elements or scenes, to help ensure the player knows what you mean.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Online surveys can save you (and your playtesters) a lot of time</b>. Systems like SurveyMonkey or Google Forms are easy to set up and are free or inexpensive.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Don&#8217;t ask people to rate things on a scale from 1 to 10</b>. You will get more consistent results if you use a five-point scale, where each of the points is clearly labeled, such as</p>
<ul class="list-alpha-lower">
<li><p class="list-item">Terrible</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item">Pretty bad</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item"><span id="p492" aria-label=" page 492. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>So-so</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item">Good</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item">Excellent</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Don&#8217;t put too many questions on your survey</b>, or people will start to tune out near the end, and your results won&#8217;t be worth much.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Give them the survey right after they have played</b>, while things are fresh in their mind.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Have someone on hand to answer clarifying questions</b> that the testers might have about the survey.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Note the age and gender of each playtester surveyed</b>, so you can see if these have a connection to player opinions.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Don&#8217;t take survey data as gospel</b>. It is unlikely that your survey is truly scientific, and playtesters tend to make things up when they aren&#8217;t sure.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec28_9_2"><span class="pd_orange">Interviews</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">A postgame interview is a great way to ask players questions too complex for a simple survey sheet. It&#8217;s also a way to get a sense of how they really felt about the game, since you can see emotion in their faces and hear it in their voices. Here are some interview tips:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list"><b>Have a script of questions</b> ready when you interview people. Leave space so you can write down their responses. Also leave space for general notes when the conversation takes unexpected turns (in other words, be ready for surprises!).</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Interview people privately</b>, when possible. People will speak more honestly in a one-on-one situation than in a case where others (particularly people they know) are listening in. If the tester has other friends who are testing, consider doing a group interview only after the private interview is done, to see if new information comes out when the close friends are talking to each other.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Playtesters will avoid hurting your feelings</b>, particularly if they know (or think) you helped make the game. Sometimes, staying objective is not enough. I sometimes make a big show of saying &#8220;I need your help. This game has some real problems, but we&#8217;re not sure what they are. Please, if there is anything at all you don&#8217;t like about this game, it will be a great help to me if you let me know.&#8221; This gives a tester permission to speak honestly about their likes and dislikes.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Avoid memory tests</b>. Asking players questions like &#8220;On level 3, when you got to the yellow butterflies, you flew left instead of right. Why?&#8221; will generally get you blank stares. Players are so busy playing the game; they don&#8217;t always form memories about things that are not immediately relevant to the goal of the game. <span id="p493" aria-label=" page 493. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>If you need answers to questions like that, you should ask them while the game is being played.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Don&#8217;t expect playtesters to be game designers</b>. Questions like &#8220;Would the game have been better if level three were harder?&#8221; may not get the results you want. In general, players always think they want the game to be easier, so they are likely to say &#8220;no&#8221; to that question. Most playtesters are not skilled at thinking about and discussing game mechanics. A better way to ask the same thing would be &#8220;were any parts of level three boring?,&#8221; which will probably get you an honest answer and the information you are looking for.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Ask for more than you need</b>. Instead of asking &#8220;what was your least favorite part?&#8221; why not ask &#8220;what were your three least favorite parts?&#8221; You&#8217;ll get more data, and it will be sorted by priority&#8230; the thing that stands out most in a player&#8217;s mind will come first.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Consider a video closet</b>. The video closet is an invention of game designer Barbara Chamberlin, who leads the Learning Games Lab at New Mexico State University. As she puts it, &#8220;The video closet is just a space set aside with a video camera or iPad, and a whiteboard where we can write questions. When we prompt them, players go in one at a time, read the question, and can then think and reflect on it. When ready, our player turns the camera on and just talks through the answer. This has been amazing at countering groupthink, and helping some of the quieter players offer their voice. It works best when we&#8217;ve asked them related questions outside of the closet in a focus group or interview, and then they can go in and individually provide more depth or a different perspective. It has been a fantastic way to get thick, rich feedback, and&#8212;because it&#8217;s all recorded&#8212;it&#8217;s easy to share with the team and clients!&#8221; I can absolutely testify to the power of the video closet&#8212;somehow, people will say things to a camera that they&#8217;d never say to your face.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Set your ego aside</b>. It can be very hard to sit and listen to someone tell you how bad your game is. You will be sorely tempted to step in and defend your game and tell them how it is supposed to be. Resist this urge. No one cares how the game was supposed to be during this interview. Right now, all that matters is how this playtester feels about the game, and why. When you feel the temptation rise within you, steel yourself, and ask objective questions like &#8220;What don&#8217;t you like about it?&#8221; and &#8220;Can you tell me more about that?&#8221;</p></li>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec28_9_3"><span class="pd_orange">FFWWDD</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">FFWWDD is another helpful acronym from Shawn Patton. It&#8217;s six easy to remember questions that you might want to ask your players after they play your game. This set of six questions is our go-to at Schell Games, so I thought I would share them here.</p>
<ol class="list-order">
<li><p class="list"><span id="p494" aria-label=" page 494. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>What was the most <b>frustrating</b> moment or aspect of what you just played?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">What was your <b>favorite</b> moment or aspect of what you just played?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Was there anything you <b>wanted</b> to do that you couldn&#8217;t?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">If you had a magic <b>wand</b> to wave, and you could change, add, or remove anything from the experience, what would it be?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">What were you <b>doing</b> in the experience?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">How would you <b>describe</b> this game to your friends and family?</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">We ask the questions in this order, for a reason. Question one (frustrating) gives players a chance to vent about whatever irritated them. Question two (favorite) is important because it tells you about the high point of their experience. Questions three and four (wanted and wand) might seem the same&#8230; but they aren&#8217;t. Players tend to tell you about small desires with question three, but really think outside of the box on question four. Question five (doing) tells you about what the player&#8217;s goal was, and question six (describe) gives you great information about their perceptions of the point of the overall experience.</p>
<p class="indent">As technology advances and real-time analytics and dependence on microtransaction revenue become increasingly critical, the more playtesting is merging into ongoing game tuning. But don&#8217;t let that throw you&#8212;testing is testing. In the end, it&#8217;s all about collecting information about what people like and what they don&#8217;t and intelligently using that information to make better choices about your design.</p>
