<p class="noindent">If we are to create games that have great stories in them, these stories must contain memorable characters. It is an important question to ask: How are characters in games different than characters in other media? If we examine fictional characters in various media side by side, some differences become apparent. Here are some samples I chose from lists of the best novels, films, and videogames of the twentieth century.</p>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec20_1_1"><span class="pd_orange">Novel Characters</span></h3>
<ul class="list-simple1">
<li><p class="list-item1"><b>Holden Caulfield</b>: <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i>. Holden is a teenager who wrestles with the phoniness and ugliness of the adult world.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item1"><b>Humbert Humbert</b>: <i>Lolita</i>. Humbert is an adult consumed by lust for an adolescent girl.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item1"><b>Tom Joad</b>: <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>. Tom is an ex-convict who tries to help his family after they lose their farm.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item1"><b>Ralph</b>: <i>Lord of the Flies</i>. Ralph and many other children are stranded on an island and try to survive the island and each other.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item1"><b>Sethe</b>: <i>Beloved</i>. Sethe is a woman who tries to rebuild her life after she and her daughter escape from slavery.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec20_1_2"><span class="pd_orange">Movie Characters</span></h3>
<ul class="list-simple1">
<li><p class="list-item1"><b>Rick Blaine</b>: <i>Casablanca</i>. Rick must choose between the love of his life and saving the life of her husband.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item1"><b>Indiana Jones</b>: <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>. An adventurous archaeologist must rescue the Ark of the Covenant from the Nazis.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item1"><b>Rose DeWitt Bukater</b>: <i>Titanic</i>. A young woman falls in love on the ill-fated Titanic.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item1"><b>Norman Bates</b>: <i>Psycho</i>. A man with an unusual case of schizophrenia commits murders and tries to cover them up.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item1"><b>Don Lockwood</b>: <i>Singin&#8217; in the Rain</i>. A silent film actor struggles to make the transition to talkies.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec20_1_3"><span class="pd_orange">Game Characters</span></h3>
<ul class="list-simple1">
<li><p class="list-item1"><b>Mario</b>: <i>Super Mario Brothers</i>. A cartoon plumber battles enemies to rescue a princess from an evil king.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item1"><b>Solid Snake</b>: <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>. A retired soldier infiltrates a nuclear weapons disposal facility to neutralize a terrorist threat.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item1"><b>Cloud Strife</b>: <i>Final Fantasy VII</i>. A band of rebels tries to defeat an evil megacorporation run by an evil wizard.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item1"><span id="p373" aria-label=" page 373. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><b>Link</b>: <i>Legend of Zelda</i>. A young man must recover a magic artifact to rescue a princess from a villain.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-item1"><b>Gordon Freeman</b>: <i>Half-Life 2</i>. A physicist must battle aliens when an experiment goes horribly wrong.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">So, examining these lists, what patterns do we see?</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list"><b>Mental</b> &#8594; <b>Physical</b>. The characters in the novels are involved in deep psychic struggles. This makes sense, since in a novel we spend much of our time listening to the characters&#8217; innermost thoughts. The characters in the movies are involved in both emotional and physical struggles, which are resolved through combinations of communication and action. Again, when you consider the medium, this makes sense: We cannot hear the thoughts of film characters, but we can see what they say and do. Finally, the game characters are involved in conflicts that are almost entirely physical. Since these characters mostly have no thoughts (the player does the thinking for them) and are only occasionally able to speak, this again makes perfect sense. In all three cases, the characters are defined by their media.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Reality</b> &#8594; <b>Fantasy</b>. The novels tend to be very reality based; the films tend to be rooted in reality, but often pushing toward fantasy, and the game worlds are almost entirely fantasy situations. And the characters reflect this&#8212;they are products of their environment.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Complex</b> &#8594; <b>Simple</b>. For a variety of reasons, the complexity of the plots and depth of the characters gradually diminishes as we move from novels to games.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">From this, one might conclude that games are doomed to have simple fantasy characters engaging mostly in physical actions. And that certainly is the easy path. After all, you can get away with mere action in games when you usually can&#8217;t in movies or novels. But it doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t possible to add more depth, more mental conflict, and more interesting character relationships into your games&#8212;it just means that it is challenging. Some of the games on this list, <i>Final Fantasy VII</i>, for instance, have very involved sets of character relationships structured around a simple gameplay structure&#8212;as involved as they are, players are crying out for more&#8212;they want their games to have richer, more meaningful characters and storylines. For much of this chapter, we will be looking at methods that storytellers in other media use to define their characters and consider how we can adapt these methods to the creation of strong game characters.</p>
<p class="indent">Let&#8217;s start with a very special character: the avatar.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="level3">
<h2 class="h3" id="sec20_2"><span class="pd_orange">Avatars</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">There is something magical about the character that a player controls in a game, so magical that we give that character a special name: the avatar. The word is derived <span id="p374" aria-label=" page 374. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>from a Sanskrit word that refers to a god magically taking physical form on earth. And the name is well chosen for a game character, since a similarly magical transformation takes place when players use their avatar to enter the world of the game.</p>
<p class="indent">The relationship between player and avatar is strange. There are times when the player is distinctly apart from the avatar, but other times when the player&#8217;s mental state is completely projected into the avatar, to the point that the player gasps if the avatar is injured or threatened. This should not be completely surprising&#8212;after all, we have the ability to project ourselves into just about anything we control. When we drive a car, for example, we project our identity into the car, as if it is an extension of ourselves. Examining a parking space, we will often say &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I can fit in there.&#8221; And if another car collides with our car, we don&#8217;t say &#8220;He hit my car!&#8221; Instead we say &#8220;He hit me!&#8221; So it should be no surprise that we can project ourselves into a videogame character that we have direct control over.</p>
<p class="indent">Designers often debate about which is more immersive: the first- or third-person view. One argument is that greater projection can be achieved by providing a first-person perspective on a scene with no visible avatar. However, the power of empathy is strong, and when controlling a visible avatar, guests often wince in imagined pain upon seeing their avatar suffer a blow or sigh in relief upon seeing their avatar escape physical harm. It is almost as if the avatar is a kind of kinesthetic voodoo doll for the guest. Bowlers are another example of this phenomenon, as they try to exert &#8220;body English&#8221; on a bowling ball as it rolls down the lane toward the pins. These movements are largely subconscious and are a result of a bowler projecting themself onto the ball. In this sense, the bowling ball serves as the bowler&#8217;s avatar.</p>
<p class="indent">And it is one thing to project ourselves into our avatar as if our avatar is a tool, but the experience of projection can be so much more powerful if we actually relate to the character in some way. So, what kinds of characters are best suited for players to project themselves into?</p>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec20_2_1"><span class="pd_orange">The Ideal Form</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The first type of character that is a good choice as an avatar is the kind that the player has always wanted to be. Characters like this&#8212;such as mighty warriors, powerful wizards, attractive princesses, ultra-suave secret agents&#8212;exert a pull on the psyche, since the force inside us that pushes us toward being our best finds the idea of projecting ourselves into an idealized form very appealing. Although these characters are not much like our real selves at all, they are people we sometimes dream about being.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec20_2_2"><span class="pd_orange">The Blank Slate</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The second type of character that works well as an avatar is one that is, as Scott McCloud puts it, iconic. In his excellent book, <i>Understanding Comics</i>, McCloud <span id="p375" aria-label=" page 375. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>makes the interesting point that the less detail that goes into a character, the more opportunity the reader has to project themselves into that character.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">McCloud further points out that in comics, it is often the case that characters or environments that are meant to seem alien, foreign, or scary are given a lot of detail, because more detail makes them more &#8220;other.&#8221; When you combine an iconic character with a detailed world, you get a powerful combination, as McCloud shows in the following:</p>

<img alt="" src="../images/fig20_3.jpg"/>
<p class="caption">(Courtesy of Harper Collins. Used with permission.)</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">This idea has bearing well beyond the domain of comics. In videogames, we see the same phenomenon. Some of the most popular and compelling avatars are ones that are very iconic. Consider Mario: He isn&#8217;t much of an idealized form, but he is simple, hardly speaks, and is completely nonthreatening, so it is easy to project yourself into him.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="p376" aria-label=" page 376. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The idealized form and the blank slate are often mixed. Consider Spider-Man, for example. He is an ideal form: a powerful and brave superhero, but the mask that covers his face makes him almost completely iconic&#8212;a blank slate that could be almost anyone.</p>
<p class="indent">Periodically, gimmicky systems show up that let you take your own photograph and put it on your avatar. I&#8217;ve heard people selling these systems refer to this as &#8220;the ultimate dream for any gamer.&#8221; But these systems, while interesting as a novelty, never take hold in the long term because people don&#8217;t play games to be themselves&#8212;they play games to be the people they wish they could be.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a class="nounder" href="C19_chapter16.xhtml#chapter16">Chapter 16</a>: <a class="nounder" href="C19_chapter16.xhtml#chapter16"><i>Interest Curve</i></a>, we introduced <a href="C19_chapter16.xhtml#box72">Lens #72</a>: <i><a href="C19_chapter16.xhtml#box72">Projection</a></i> as a tool to examine how well players project themselves into the imaginary world of the game. We should also add a more specific lens, which examines how well they project themselves into their avatar.</p>

<h2 class="box-title"><a href="C02b_tol.xhtml#rbox85"><span class="pd_whitez">#85 The Lens of the Avatar</span></a></h2>
<p class="noindent">The avatar is a player&#8217;s gateway into the world of the game. To ensure the avatar brings out as much of the player&#8217;s identity as possible, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">Is my avatar an ideal form likely to resonate with my players?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Does my avatar have iconic qualities that let a player project themselves into the character?</p></li>

<section class="level3">
<h2 class="h3" id="sec20_3"><span class="pd_orange">Creating Compelling Game Characters</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The avatar is important in a game, just as the protagonist is important in a traditional story. But we must not forget the other characters. There are dozens of books on scriptwriting and storytelling that can give you good advice on how to make <span id="p377" aria-label=" page 377. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>strong, compelling characters. Here I will summarize some of the methods I have found most useful for developing characters in games.</p>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec20_3_1"><span class="pd_orange">Character Tip #1: List Character Functions</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">In the process of creating a story, one frequently invents characters as the storyline demands them. But how about when the game demands them? A very useful technique when coming up with the cast of characters in your game is to list all the functions that these characters need to fulfill. Then list the characters you had been thinking of putting in the game, and see how they match up. For example, if you are making an action platform game, your list might look like the following:</p>
<p class="noindentt"><b>Character Functions</b>:</p>
<ol class="list-order">
<li><p class="list">Hero: the character who plays the game</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Mentor: gives advice and useful items</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Assistant: gives occasional tips</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Tutor: explains how to play the game</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Final boss: someone to have the last battle against</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Minions: bad guys</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Three bosses: tough guys to battle against</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Hostage: someone to rescue</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">Taking a peek into your imagination, you might have seen these characters:</p>
<ol class="list-alpha-lower1">
<li><p class="list">Princess Mouse: beautiful, but tough and no nonsense</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Wise Old Owl: full of wisdom, but forgetful</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Silver Hawk: angry and vengeful</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Sammy Snake: amoral and full of wry humor</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Rat Army: hundreds of rats with evil red eyes</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">So, now you have to match the characters to the functions. This is an opportunity to really get creative. The traditional thing would be to make Princess Mouse the hostage. But why not do something different; make her the mentor? Or the hero? Or even the final boss! The Rat Army seem like natural minions&#8212;but who knows? Maybe they only have evil red eyes because they have been captured by the evil Princess Mouse who has hypnotized them, and they are actually the hostages! Hmm&#8230; it also seems we don&#8217;t have enough characters to fill all eight roles&#8212;we could make up more characters, or we could give some characters <span id="p378" aria-label=" page 378. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>multiple roles. What if your mentor, Wise Old Owl, turns out to be the final boss? It would be an ironic twist and save you on the cost of developing a new character. Maybe the Assistant and Tutor are both Sammy Snake&#8212;or maybe the Silver Hawk, the hostage, mentors you by sending telepathic messages from where he is being held.</p>
<p class="indent">By separating the functions of the characters from your vision of the characters, you can think clearly about making sure the game has characters doing all the necessary jobs and sometimes make things more efficient by folding them together. This method serves as a handy lens.</p>
<aside class="boxed-text" epub:type="tip" role="doc-tip" id="box86">
<h2 class="box-title"><a href="C02b_tol.xhtml#rbox86"><span class="pd_whitez">#86 The Lens of Character Function</span></a></h2>
<p class="noindent">To make sure your characters are doing everything your game needs them to do, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">What are the roles I need the characters to fill?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">What characters have I already imagined?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Which characters map well to which roles?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Can any characters fill more than one role?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Do I need to change the characters to better fit the roles?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Do I need any new characters?</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec20_3_2"><span class="pd_orange">Character Tip #2: Define and Use Character Traits</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Let&#8217;s say we had some dialog between your heroine, Sabu, and her sidekick, Lester&#8212;simple expositional stuff, which helps set up the next level. Something like</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="speech">LESTER: Sabu!</p>
<p class="speech">SABU: What is it?</p>
<p class="speech">LESTER: Someone has stolen the king&#8217;s crown!</p>
<p class="speech">SABU: Do you realize what this means?</p>
<p class="speech">LESTER: No.</p>
<p class="speech">SABU: It means the Dark Arrow has returned. We must stop him!</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent"><span id="p379" aria-label=" page 379. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>This dialog is pretty flat. While it tells us about the situation (missing crown) and the villain (Dark Arrow), it tells us nothing about Sabu or Lester. Your characters need to say and do things that define them as real people. To do this, you must know their traits.</p>
<p class="indent">There are many ways to define traits for your characters. Some advise creating a &#8220;character bible,&#8221; where you list out every possible thing you can think of that defines your character&#8212;their loves and hates, how they dress, what they eat, where they grew up, etc. And this can be a useful exercise. But ultimately, you will probably want to boil things down to a simpler essence: a small, distilled list of traits that encapsulate the character. You want to choose traits that are going to stay with your character through many situations that really define them as a person. Sometimes these can be a little contradictory, but real people have contradictory traits, so why shouldn&#8217;t characters? Let&#8217;s say we gave Sabu and Lester these traits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="speech"><i>Sabu: trustworthy, short tempered, valiant, a fiery lover</i></p>
<p class="speech"><i>Lester: arrogant, sarcastic, spiritual, impulsive</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Now, let&#8217;s rewrite the dialog, trying to imbue it with these traits&#8212;preferably with more than one at a time (remember <a href="C16_chapter13.xhtml#box49">Lens #49</a>: <i><a href="C16_chapter13.xhtml#box49">Elegance</a></i>?).</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="speech">LESTER (exploding into the room): By the Gods! Sabu, I have news! (impulsive and spiritual)</p>
<p class="speech">SABU: (covering herself): How dare you intrude on my privacy! (short tempered)</p>
<p class="speech">LESTER: Whatever. Maybe you don&#8217;t care that the king&#8217;s crown has been stolen? (arrogant and sarcastic)</p>
<p class="speech">SABU (a faraway look in her eye): This means I must do what I promised&#8230; (trustworthy and valiant)</p>
<p class="speech">LESTER: I pray to Vishnu this is not another story of an old flame&#8230; (Lester: spiritual and sarcastic; Sabu: fiery lover)</p>
<p class="speech">SABU: Silence! The Dark Arrow broke my heart, and the heart of my sister&#8212;I promised her that if he ever returned, I would risk my life to destroy him. Prepare the chariot! (short tempered, fiery lover, trustworthy, valiant)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">It isn&#8217;t simply dialog that benefits from this treatment. The actions you choose for your character, and how they are carried out, should demonstrate the traits as well. If your character is sneaky, does it show in their jump animation? If your character is depressed, does it show when they run? Maybe a depressed character shouldn&#8217;t run, but only walk. There is nothing magical about having lists of traits and using them&#8212;it just means that you know your characters well.</p>

<p class="noindent">Your characters won&#8217;t be alone, of course&#8212;they are going to interact with each other. One tool that Katherine Isbister brought from the world of social psychology into the world of game design is the <b>interpersonal circumplex</b>. It is a graph you can use to visualize the relationships between characters. It has two axes: friendliness and dominance. This complex diagram shows where many traits lie on this graph:</p>
<p class="indent">This looks kind of overwhelming, but it can be a simple tool to use. Let&#8217;s say we wanted to show how other <i>Star Wars</i> characters related to Han Solo. Since friendliness and dominance are relative characteristics, we always need to make them relative to a particular character. So <a class="figure" href="C23_chapter20.xhtml#fig20_5">Figure 20.5</a> is how you might graph out the characters relative to Han.</p>
<p class="indent">Laying the characters out on a graph like this gives a good way to visualize character relationships. Notice how extreme Darth Vader, Chewbacca, and C-3PO are on the graph&#8212;these extremes are part of what makes them interesting. Also notice that the people he communicates with the most are the closest to him on the graph. What does the fact that there are no characters in the lower left quadrant tell us about Han? Consider how different the graphs would be for Luke, or for Darth Vader.</p>

<p class="noindent">Understanding the relationships between your characters is crucial. One way to do this is to create a graph with one axis labeled hostile/friendly and the other labeled submissive/dominant. Pick a character to analyze, and put them in the middle. Plot out where other characters lie relative to that character, and ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">Are there any gaps in the chart? Why are they there? Would it be better if the gaps were filled?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Are there &#8220;extreme characters&#8221; on the graph? If not, would it be better if there were?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Are the character&#8217;s friends in the same quadrant, or different quadrants? What if that were different?</p></li>

<p class="noindent">The circumplex is a nice visual way to see some character relationships. But there can be many other factors in the relationships between your characters. The character web is a good way to explore how the characters feel about each other and why. The idea is simple: To analyze a character, write down what that character thinks of all the other characters. Here&#8217;s an example from the world of Archie comics:</p>
<section class="level5">
<h4 class="h5" id="sec20_3_4_1"><span class="pd_orange">Archie</span></h4>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list"><b>Veronica</b>: Archie is lured by her elegance and beauty. Though she is rich, Archie doesn&#8217;t care much about that.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Betty</b>: Archie&#8217;s true love, but her insecurity constantly gives him mixed signals, so he doesn&#8217;t pursue her as forcefully as he might.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Reggie</b>: Archie shouldn&#8217;t trust Reggie, but he often does, because Archie always tries to be a nice guy and Archie is kind of gullible.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Jughead</b>: Archie&#8217;s best friend. What they have in common is that they are both underdogs.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list"><b>Archie</b>: Veronica finds Archie attractive, but sometimes she seeks to date him to frustrate Betty and because she can always feel superior around him.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Betty</b>: Veronica trusts Betty as a friend because they were friends as little girls. Veronica likes how she can always feel superior to Betty in terms of wealth and class, but it really frustrates Veronica that Betty is a better person.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Reggie</b>: Reggie is an attractive buffoon who appreciates wealth, but Veronica gets frustrated that Reggie doesn&#8217;t really respect or love her.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Jughead</b>: A nauseating freak&#8212;Veronica can&#8217;t understand why Archie is friends with him. Veronica often bribes him with food to get what she wants.</p></li>

<li><p class="list"><b>Jughead</b>: Betty thinks he&#8217;s cute and funny and glad that he&#8217;s such a good friend to her true love.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list"><b>Archie</b>: Reggie&#8217;s archrival. Reggie can&#8217;t imagine what anyone sees in such a dopey nice guy. Occasionally, Reggie envies Archie&#8217;s popularity, but he always thinks he can find a tricky way to outdo Archie.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Veronica</b>: Reggie finds her attractive and rich&#8212;he likes the power of her wealth.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Betty</b>: Reggie finds her attractive, and though her low self-esteem is a turnoff, to be able to win her, he would show his superiority over Archie.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">You can see that this takes a little time, but it can be well worth the effort because of the questions it raises about character interactions you might not have thought about. It&#8217;s a very handy lens for giving your characters more depth.</p>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec20_3_5"><span class="pd_orange">Character Tip #5: Use Status</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Most of the character tips we&#8217;ve seen so far come from writers. But there is another profession that knows just as much about creating compelling characters, if not more&#8212;actors. Many people have drawn parallels between the unpredictable nature of interactive storytelling and the unpredictable nature of improvisational theater; indeed, the techniques of the improvisational actor can prove quite useful to game designers. These techniques are many and are well described in several books, but there is one, for me, that stands out above all others. It is really not so much a technique, but a lens described impeccably well by Keith Johnstone in his classic book <i>Impro</i>&#8212;it is the Lens of Status.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="p385" aria-label=" page 385. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Whenever people meet or interact, there is a hidden negotiation that constantly takes place. We are mostly not conscious of it, since it predates our ability to speak. It is our negotiation of status; that is, who is in charge of the current interaction? Status is not a matter of who you are; status is something you do. Johnstone illustrates this quite well with this bit of dialog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="speech">TRAMP: &#8216;Ere! Where are you going?</p>
<p class="speech">DUCHESS: I&#8217;m sorry, I didn&#8217;t quite catch&#8230;</p>
<p class="speech">TRAMP: Are you deaf as well as blind?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">The tramp, who you might expect to be very low status, is taking on an attitude of very high status. Any time two or more people interact in any setting&#8212;whether friends or enemies, collaborators or competitors, masters or servants&#8212;a negotiation of status takes place. We do this almost entirely subconsciously with posture, tone of voice, eye contact, and dozens of other detailed behaviors. What is surprising is how consistent these behaviors are across all cultures.</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list"><b>Typical low-status behaviors include</b> fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, touching one&#8217;s own face, and generally being tense.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Typical high-status behaviors include</b> being relaxed and in control, making strong eye contact, and, weirdly, not moving your head while you speak.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">A typical improv exercise is to split the group of actors into two groups, who then intermingle&#8212;individuals in the first group (low status) make brief eye contact, then look away, while the second group (high status) makes and holds eye contact with others. Most actors who try this exercise quickly realize that this isn&#8217;t just playing pretend&#8212;the actors in the low-status group quickly find that they feel inferior and start unconsciously taking on other low-status characteristics. The actors in the high-status group start to feel superior and take on high-status characteristics. Even if you are by yourself, try talking without moving your head at all, and see how it makes you feel&#8212;or try the opposite&#8212;talking while turning your head frequently, and you will quickly get the idea.</p>
<p class="indent">Status is a relative thing, not absolute to an individual. Darth Vader takes on high-status behavior when he deals with Princess Leia, but he takes on low status when he deals with the Emperor.</p>
<p class="indent">Status can be conveyed in surprising ways&#8212;slow motion, for example, gives high status, as we&#8217;ve seen in <i>The Six Million Dollar Man, The Matrix</i>, and countless shampoo commercials. The way characters occupy space is also very telling of status. Low-status characters go to places where they are less likely to encounter others or be noticed. High-status characters are in the most important place in the room.</p>
<p class="indent">Status is like a secret language that we all know so well we don&#8217;t know we&#8217;re speaking it. The problem with it being so subconscious is that when we create artificial characters, it doesn&#8217;t occur to us to give them these behaviors, because generally we aren&#8217;t aware that we do these things. But if you do give these behaviors to <span id="p386" aria-label=" page 386. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>your characters, you will quickly find that they seem aware of each other in a way that most videogame characters are not.</p>
<p class="indent">The game <i>Munch&#8217;s Oddysee</i> has great examples of character status interactions. In it, you control two different characters, one of whom is a slave and the other is bound to a wheelchair (low status). Throughout the game, you face arrogant (high-status) enemies and get help from slavish (low-status) followers. The interactions between all these are quite interesting to see, and a great deal of comedy comes from unexpected status reversals, such as the followers mouthing off at Munch or at the enemies. The characters in this game show an awareness of each other&#8217;s presence that, while crude, is a step above many other games.</p>
<p class="indent">Status is a largely unexplored area in interactive entertainment. Brenda Harger, who first introduced me to the concept of status, is an excellent improv actress and a researcher at the Entertainment Technology Center at Carnegie Mellon University. She and her students have done some fascinating work on creating artificially intelligent characters that are aware of their status and of the status of other characters and automatically adopt appropriate postures, actions, and personal space. Right now, most videogame characters behave the same way no matter who is around. It seems likely that the next generation of interactive game characters will seem more alive because they are aware of status.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a class="nounder" href="C19_chapter16.xhtml#chapter16">Chapter 16</a>: <a class="nounder" href="C19_chapter16.xhtml#chapter16"><i>Interest Curve</i></a>, we talked about how important things that change dramatically are inherently interesting. Status is one of those important things. During arguments, people are vying to have the highest status (either by raising their own or lowering the status of their opponent), and this seesaw of status is what makes arguments interesting.</p>
<p class="indent">Status isn&#8217;t just about dialog, though&#8212;it is also about movement, eye contact, territory, and what characters do. It is a way of looking at the world, so let&#8217;s put it in our toolbox.</p>

<p class="noindent">When people interact, they take on different behaviors depending on their status levels. To make your characters more aware of each other, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">What are the relative status levels of the characters in my game?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">How can they show appropriate status behaviors?</p></li>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec20_3_6"><span class="pd_orange">Character Tip #6: Use the Power of the Voice</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The human voice is an incredibly powerful thing, which can affect us at a deep subconscious level. This is why talking pictures elevated the cinema from a novelty to the dominant art form of the twentieth century. It is only in the past few years that technology has permitted videogames to make serious use of voice acting. Even now, the voice acting in games seems primitive compared to the powerful performances in films.</p>
<p class="indent">Partly, this is true because game developers are often inexperienced when working with voice talent. Directing a voice actor is a delicate art that takes a certain knack and years of practice to do well. But there is another reason for weak voice acting in games&#8212;it is because we do the process backwards. In animated films, a script is written first, and then voice actors are brought in to record it. As they do, lines are changed, improvisations are made, and the good ones are incorporated into the script. Once the recordings are in place, the characters get designed (often incorporating facial features of the actors), and animation commences. In videogames, we do this the other way&#8212;the characters are often designed and modeled first; then the script is written, often basic animations are created; and then the voice acting is added last. This diminishes the power of the voice actor, who is now just trying to imitate what they see, instead of rightly expressing how they truly feel their character would act and behave. The voice actor becomes peripheral to the creative process, not central, and the power of voice is weakened.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="p388" aria-label=" page 388. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Why do we do this backwards? Because the process of game development is so volatile, it is expensive to create characters around their voices, since the script continues to change throughout the entire process. Hopefully, with time, we will develop techniques that will allow voice actors to become more central to game character design and reclaim the power of voice. Naughty Dog is one company that takes this notion seriously&#8212;both the Uncharted series and The Last of Us involved dozens of recording sessions that spanned the length of the projects, and the iterative work with the voice actors seems to have made a real difference in the emotional power of these games.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec20_3_7"><span class="pd_orange">Character Tip #7: Use the Power of the Face</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">A huge percentage of our brains is taken up with custom hardware for processing facial expression. We have the most complex and expressive faces in the entire animal kingdom. Notice, for example, our eye whites&#8212;other animals do not have visible eye whites. It would appear we evolved them as a method of communication. We are also the only animal that blushes and the only animal that cries.</p>
<p class="indent">Despite all these, few videogames give facial animation the attention it deserves. Game designers are so focused on the actions of the characters that they give little thought to their emotions. When a game does have meaningful facial animation (such as <i>Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</i>), it often garners a lot of attention. The designers of OnLive Traveler, an early 3D chat room, had very strict polygon budgets for their characters. As they built and tested prototypes, they would ask their users each time: &#8220;Do the characters need more details?&#8221; And every time, the answer would come back, &#8220;Yes&#8212; in the face.&#8221; After five or six rounds of this, the bodies dwindled away to nothing, leaving the characters as eerie floating heads&#8212;but this was what the users preferred, since this was an activity about self-expression, and faces are the most expressive tool that exists.</p>
<p class="indent">Facial animation doesn&#8217;t have to be expensive&#8212;you can get tremendous power out of simple animated eyebrows or eye shapes. But you do have to have a character face that will be visible to the player. Avatar faces generally are not visible to the player. The designers of <i>Doom</i> found a way to change that by putting a small picture of the avatar&#8217;s face on the bottom of the screen. Since we can notice facial expression in our peripheral vision more easily than we can discern numbers, they wisely made the facial expression correspond to the health meter, so that players got a sense of how injured they were without having to take their eyes off of their enemies.</p>
<p class="indent">Most of all, you should focus on your characters&#8217; eyes. It is said that the eyes are the windows to the soul, but so often, videogame characters have dull, dead eyes. If you can bring the eyes of your character to life, the whole character will come alive. Want your villain to seem evil? Focus on the eyes. Want your zombie to seem creepy? Give him creepy eyes. Want your penguin to seem cute? Focus on cute eyes. Another interesting fact about eyes&#8212;we use them to tell who is related. Look at the <span id="p389" aria-label=" page 389. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>cartoon eyes in <i>The Simpsons</i>, for example&#8212;each family has one set of eyes. Eyes hold many secrets. Give them proper attention, and your characters will thank you by coming to life.</p>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec20_3_8"><span class="pd_orange">Character Tip #8: Powerful Stories Transform Characters</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p class="quote"><i>People do not change, they are merely revealed.</i></p>
<p class="right">&#8212;Anne Enright</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">One distinguishing feature of great stories is how their characters change. Video game designers seldom consider this, to their detriment. There is a tendency to treat game characters as fixed types&#8212;the villain is always the villain, the hero was born a hero. This makes for very boring storytelling. A few games, such as <i>Fable</i> and <i>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</i>, became famous because of the fact that they do what nearly every successful movie or book does&#8212;let events change the main character over time.</p>
<p class="indent">It is certainly true that meaningful character change is not possible for the main character in every game. But perhaps character change can happen to other characters in the game such as the sidekick or the villain. A great way to <span id="p390" aria-label=" page 390. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>visualize the potential for character change in your game is to make a character transformation chart, with characters on the left side and the different sections of your story along the top. Then, mark down the places where a character undergoes some kind of change. For example, consider the changes in the story of Cinderella:</p>
<figure class="informaltable">
<img alt="" src="../images/c020_untbl_1.jpg"/>
</figure>
<p class="indent">By looking at each character over time, instead of just the story thread, we get a unique perspective that helps us to better understand our characters. Some transformations are temporary and small, others are great and permanent. By considering how your characters should change and making the most of that, your game will tell a far more powerful story than if they pass through the story untouched by it. This perspective of character transformation is our final character lens.</p>

<p class="noindent">We pay attention to character transformation, because we care about what might change us. To ensure your characters are transforming in interesting ways, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">How does each of my characters change throughout the game?</p></li>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec20_3_9"><span class="pd_orange">Character Tip #9: Let Your Characters Surprise Us</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">In the novel <i>Tender is the Night</i> by F. Scott Fitzgerald, there is a conversation between Rosemary and Dick, which is terribly important to us as storytellers. It begins with Rosemary, the actress, asking a simple question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="quote"><i>&#8220;I wanted to ask you what you thought of my latest pictures&#8212; if you saw them.&#8221;</i></p>
<p class="quote1"><i>&#8220;It&#8217;ll take a few minutes to tell you,&#8221; Dick said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s suppose that Nicole says to you that Lanier is ill. What do you do in life? What does anyone do? They ACT&#8212; face, voice, words&#8212; the face shows sorrow, the voice shows shock, the words show sympathy.&#8221;</i></p>
<p class="quote1"><i>&#8220;Yes&#8212; I understand.&#8221;</i></p>
<p class="quote1"><i>&#8220;But in the theatre, No. In the theatre all the best comediennes have built up their reputations by burlesquing the correct emotional responses&#8212; fear and love and sympathy.&#8221;</i></p>
<p class="quote1"><i>&#8220;I see.&#8221; Yet she did not quite see.</i></p>
<p class="quote1"><i>&#8220;The danger to an actress is in responding. Again, let&#8217;s suppose that somebody told you, &#8216;Your lover is dead.&#8217; In life you&#8217;d probably go to pieces. But on the stage you&#8217;re trying to entertain&#8212;the audience can do the &#8216;responding&#8217; for themselves. First the actress has lines to follow, then she has to get the audience&#8217;s attention back on herself, away from the murdered Chinese or whatever the thing is. So she must do something unexpected. If the audience thinks the character is hard she goes soft on them&#8212;if they think she&#8217;s soft she goes hard. You go all OUT of character&#8212;you understand?&#8221;</i></p>
<p class="quote1"><i>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite,&#8221; admitted Rosemary. &#8220;How do you mean out of character?&#8221;</i></p>
<p class="quote1"><i>&#8220;You do the unexpected thing until you&#8217;ve manoeuvred the audience back from the objective fact to yourself. THEN you slide into character again.&#8221;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent"><span id="p392" aria-label=" page 392. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>This advice seems completely contrary to everything we know about storytelling and acting. We expect characters to behave realistically and believably. But here, Fitzgerald is telling us that in a good story, the characters do the opposite of what the audience expects. And it is totally true. When you know to look for it, you can see it everywhere. It&#8217;s in comedies, dramas, the classics, everywhere. The popular television show <i>Breaking Bad</i> was practically founded on this principle. It&#8217;s yet another use for The Lens of Surprise. When characters have an emotional reaction that isn&#8217;t what we expect, we pay attention. And of course, fun is just pleasure with surprises, right? If you want players to enjoy playing with your characters, design each one the same way you would design a toy. Look for ways to let your characters surprise your players, and the players will hang on your characters&#8217; every word and action.</p>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec20_3_10"><span class="pd_orange">Character Tip #10: Avoid the Uncanny Valley</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori noted something interesting about human response to robots and other artificial characters. If you think about how people empathize, you might notice that the closer something is to seeming human, the more they can empathize with it. You might even lay this out on a graph like:</p>
<figure class="figure" id="fig20_7">
<figcaption>
<p class="title"><span class="pd_orange"><small>FIGURE</small><br/><b>20.7</b></span></p>
<img alt="" src="../images/fig20_7.jpg"/>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">And this makes perfect sense. The more something is like a person, the more empathy we give it. But Mori noted an interesting exception, as he worked on robots that tried to mimic humans&#8212;as soon as they started to get too human, perhaps moving from a metal face (think C-3PO) to one with artificial skin, people suddenly found them repulsive. It made the graph look like <a class="figure" href="C23_chapter20.xhtml#fig20_8">Figure 20.8</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Mori referred to this surprising dip in the curve as &#8220;the uncanny valley.&#8221; The cause of this uneasy feeling may be that when we see things that almost look like people, our brains register them as &#8220;diseased people&#8221; who might be dangerous to be around. Zombies are a canonical example of the creepy things that live at the bottom of the uncanny valley.</p>
<p class="indent">

<img alt="" src="../images/fig20_8.jpg"/>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The uncanny valley shows up in videogames and animation all the time. Every frame of films such as <i>Final Fantasy</i> and <i>The Polar Express</i> looks gorgeous and natural&#8212;when you just look at one frame. But when the films are in motion, there is something about the computer-generated humans that many people find creepy&#8212;somehow, they don&#8217;t move quite right&#8212;they got too close to the valley and fell in. Contrast those characters to the cartoony characters (fish, toys, cars, robots) in Pixar films that have no problem generating empathy, because they stay to the left side of the valley, where that puppy dog is.</p>
<p class="indent">Videogame characters can easily have the same problems&#8212;especially in games that try to mimic reality. The day may come where videogame characters are so human looking that they can safely exist on the right side of the valley, but until then, use caution&#8212;it&#8217;s a long way down.</p>
