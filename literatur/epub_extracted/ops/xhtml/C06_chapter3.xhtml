<p class="noindent">A tremendous amount of discussion takes place in the digital game realm about platforms. Players and designers are constantly debating about PC vs. console vs. mobile vs. tablet vs. web vs. handheld vs. arcade vs. etcetera vs. etcetera. Which is the best? The most profitable? The most fun? The most likely to still be here in three years? It is human nature to assume that when something is successful, it will remain that way forever. But it isn&#8217;t the case. Some things stay, and some go. Television mostly replaced radio, but it didn&#8217;t replace movies. Arcade gaming was replaced by PC gaming, which was replaced by console gaming, but then PC gaming came back, and mobile and tablet gaming rose up. Is it random? Absolutely not. The thing that makes specific technologies come and go from our lives is as old and persistent as humanity itself. The mistake that we make again and again is to focus too much on the existing technologies (which, though new and shiny, are ephemeral) and to forget to focus on something so familiar as to be invisible: the places in our lives that we use those technologies. I like to call these venues.</p>
<p class="indent">It takes a bit of a mental shift to look past the technologies we use and instead to see the patterns of how we use them, but it is a good exercise, as it helps to give us insight about the past, present, and future of gameplay. I&#8217;ll share with you here the system of venues that I use to think about gameplay. It&#8217;s not a perfect system&#8212;it has both gaps and overlaps&#8212;but again and again I have found it useful when thinking about what kind of gameplay works best where and why.</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec3_2"><span class="pd_orange">Private Venues</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Gameplay is often aided by privacy. To take the risk of immersing yourself in a fantasy world, we like to be in a safe place, either alone or surrounded by people we know and trust. Naturally, some of the most important play spaces are in the home.</p>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec3_2_1"><span id="p27" aria-label=" page 27. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="pd_orange">The Hearth</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">One of the defining aspects of the human species is our relationship with fire. Before we understood how to use fire, we lived much more like animals. Once we mastered and tamed fire, it changed us culturally, psychologically, and physically. It gave us light, warmth, and safety. It let us cook our food, allowing a simpler digestive system and larger brains. Tending a fire was an around-the-clock responsibility, making families and large social groups more important than ever. Today, open fires are obsolete, but homes are still built with fireplaces, because it just &#8220;feels wrong&#8221; not to have one. Some anthropologists have theorized that the trance we fall into when staring at a fire may be an evolved behavior&#8212;if your mind finds it peaceful and tranquil to stare at a fire for hours on end, you have a tremendous survival advantage over someone else who gets distracted and lets it go out.</p>
<p class="indent">In most modern homes, the TV screen has replaced the fireplace. And it makes a pretty good substitute. It&#8217;s the right size, it gives light in the darkness, it flickers in a similar way, and instead of relying on family members to entertain each other by telling stories, this modern fire tells its own stories.</p>
<p class="indent">Not surprisingly, the hearth is also a good place for gameplaying. It seems to work best for games that can entertain multiple people, either by letting them play together or by being fun to watch. Nintendo&#8217;s Wii proved an excellent game system for hearth play, with a collection of games that not only could the whole family play but were also quite entertaining just to watch because of all the physical involvement in a virtual world. From the hearth point of view, it is hardly surprising that Nintendo&#8217;s follow-up system, the Wii U, was largely a disappointment, with a focus on a separate handheld screen unable to leave the hearth that only one player could see and enjoy. Similarly, popular games about singing and dancing, such as <i>SingStar</i> and <i>Dance Central</i>, are natural fits for the hearth, as we&#8217;ve been singing and dancing around the fire for over a million years.</p>
<p class="indent">When new technologies arrive, people are quick to suggest an end to the hearth. &#8220;The end of television&#8221; or &#8220;the end of game consoles&#8221; is often shouted in the press. And surely, yes, the way we enjoy stories, songs, and gameplay in the heart of our home will continue to change and evolve, but the hearth has been with us since the dawn of humanity&#8212;don&#8217;t expect it to vanish anytime soon.</p>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec3_2_2"><span class="pd_orange">The Workbench</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Most homes have some kind of private space set aside for working on hard problems. Whether it be an actual workbench in the basement for woodworking and repair projects, a sewing machine for making and fixing clothes, or a desk in a quiet corner for doing homework or writing, I refer to these collectively as &#8220;the workbench.&#8221; These places tend to be solitary and quiet and often a bit messy, since work <span id="p28" aria-label=" page 28. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>is messy and guests to the home don&#8217;t usually visit these places. When computers came into the home, they very quickly found their way to &#8220;workbench&#8221; areas, since both work and play on a computer tend to be intense and solitary. It is interesting to note the differences between &#8220;workbench&#8221; and &#8220;hearth&#8221; games. MOBAs like <i>League of Legends</i> and MMOs like <i>World of Warcraft</i>, for all their popularity, have tended to stay at the &#8220;workbench&#8221; and out of the hearth. The success of Valve&#8217;s Steam network stems greatly from the fact that other game networks (e.g., Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, and Apple) are focused mostly on other venues, leaving Steam to own the workbench.</p>
<p class="indent">Workbench games tend to be difficult and intense and can require hours of play at a time. They tend not to involve family members but may involve online play with others who are like-minded about the importance of the challenges the games provide. As of 2019, it seems that head-mounted virtual reality display systems, which favor intensity and privacy, are more at home at the workbench than at the hearth.</p>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec3_2_3"><span class="pd_orange">The Reading Nook</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Reading is a relatively new pastime for humans, only coming into popularity in the last few thousand years, but it has taken firm root. There is something magical about sitting alone with a text and letting it carry your mind away to a different world full of exciting and interesting people and places. Books are portable&#8212;we can read anywhere, but there are places we very much prefer to read. Most people prefer not to read in the hearth unless they are home alone, as it tends to be noisy and full of interruptions. Reading at the workbench isn&#8217;t very preferable either, because though it is private and quiet, it generally isn&#8217;t very comfortable. The workbench is a very &#8220;lean forward&#8221; place, whereas reading is more of a &#8220;lean back&#8221; activity. Typical reading nooks are in the bedroom or whatever room in the house that has a quiet chair or couch away from the TV.</p>
<p class="indent">But what does reading have to do with playing games? The connection isn&#8217;t obvious. PC gaming and game consoles are not good fits for the reading nook. When Apple announced the iPad, the game industry was not impressed. It didn&#8217;t have the convenience of a mobile phone that let you play games anywhere, and it didn&#8217;t have a control system that let players play the kinds of experiences so popular at the hearth and the workbench, so the game industry largely dismissed it. But the iPad did catch on as a platform for reading and watching videos, and then became a significant force in gaming. Why? Because it is the perfect platform for gameplay in the reading nook. Playing tablet games in bed, or on a couch, or in some quiet corner is very peaceful and relaxing, much like reading a book. And the games that succeed on tablets are very different than ones that succeed on game consoles or on PC. They are easier, simpler, and more relaxing&#8212;the right kind of play to suit the reading nook.</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec3_3"><span id="p29" aria-label=" page 29. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="pd_orange">Public Venues</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Not all gameplay happens in the home, of course. The world is an exciting place, full exciting people, places, and things to visit. The secret to location-based entertainment (LBE) has been well known for thousands of years. Whether you are running a tavern, a theater, a restaurant, a brothel, a theme park, or a video arcade, the rule is the same: give them something they can&#8217;t get at home.</p>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec3_3_1"><span class="pd_orange">The Theater</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">There is something magic about theaters. They come in many shapes and sizes and many purposes. Whether they be for plays, movies, musical performances, sporting events, or even planetarium shows, they have one thing in common: a large number of people gather to witness something together. Something magical happens when a crowd focuses on a sequence of events simultaneously. Somehow, we get something from the other people in the audience. I sometimes think we are able to subconsciously sense how others are feeling about the performance, and it helps focus our own feelings. This is probably why so many TV shows feature laugh tracks&#8212;there is something about appreciating an experience together that feels very satisfying.</p>
<p class="indent">But it is this very crowd that makes playing games in the theater such a problem. Games, being interactive, want to be a unique experience for each player. Time and again, people have tried to make theatrical experiences where everyone in the audience participates, but there have not been any long-term successes yet. The joy of interactivity is watered down proportionately by the number of seats, either making for an experience that gets tiresome quickly or for a theater so small as to be unprofitable. It is possible that someone will find a way to use technology to overcome this difficulty&#8212;but any solution that does so will have to be very clever indeed.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec3_3_2"><span class="pd_orange">The Arena</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">For thousands of years, competitive games have taken place in specialized fields of play. From chariot racing, to boxing, to team sports of all kinds, they all take place in the arena. Most of the time, the arena is large and out of doors, in a place specially designed for that type of gameplay. Baseball diamonds, golf courses, soccer fields, tennis courts, horse tracks, even a courtroom&#8212;all of these are a kind of arena. In addition to being specialized for this kind of gameplay, most of the time, the arena is in a public place, making it possible for others to witness what takes place there&#8212;in other words, who wins and who loses is not private, but rather a matter of public record. And since people can get pretty excited about watching these games, in many cases, a theater forms around the arena, creating two venues in one!</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="p30" aria-label=" page 30. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>So far, digital gameplay has made little impact in the traditional outdoor sports arena. But that hasn&#8217;t stopped digital gameplay from taking on the characteristics of arena play. Multiplayer first-person shooters are very much a kind of arena play: though the players are technically in the workbench or the hearth, their minds are in the arena. And, more and more, virtual theaters are springing up around this play, as more and more people are watching each other play digital games, either live (esports tournaments are sometime watched by millions of simultaneous players) or recorded, via YouTube or <a href="http://twitch.tv">twitch.tv</a>. While certainly the lines are blurring, I suspect that over time, with new mobile and augmented reality technology, we will see traditional sporting arenas become ever more digital.</p>

<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec3_3_3"><span class="pd_orange">The Museum</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes we need a break from the things in our day-to-day life, and we have a sense that by examining exotic things and places, we will get a dose of much-needed variety, we will expand our knowledge of the world, and perhaps most importantly, we will return home with a new perspective that gives new life to the commonplace things around us. Of course, museums of every sort fall into the category I call the museum, but so do many other things. Zoos and aquariums are sorts of museums, and when we go sightseeing, we treat the city we visit as a sort of museum. Even shopping trips to unusual stores are a sort of museum visit, as we look at, and imagine owning, all sorts of new and exotic objects.</p>
<p class="indent">Gameplay might seem like an unusual partner for the museum, but many games are right at home there. More and more, actual museums incorporate gameplay experiences as a way to introduce visitors to information about what they are viewing. And visiting a video arcade has a very museum-like quality, as you pass from game to game, trying each and thinking about which ones you like best.</p>

<section class="level3">
<h2 class="h3" id="sec3_4"><span class="pd_orange">Half Private/Half Public Venues</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Other venues exist somewhere between the privacy of the home and the openness of a public venue, or they find a way to exist in both. The flexibility of these spaces that live on the boundary between public and private is what makes them interesting and important.</p>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec3_4_1"><span class="pd_orange">The Gaming Table</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">There is something very special about the games that are played around a table. There is a special face-to-face intimacy as the players sit like gods over the toy world they control. Certainly, we can do this in the home, but we have a tendency to do it mostly when guests are over, making our home a bit more public than it <span id="p31" aria-label=" page 31. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>normally is. But table games also exist in more public places, such as a pool table at a bar or a poker table in a casino. There is something about table games that creates a special intensity in players. Curiously, both the sandwich and the sushi roll were invented at about the same time (the eighteenth century), though in very different parts of the world, by table gameplayers who were so obsessed with their games that they needed a way to eat without having to stop the game.</p>
<p class="indent">Board, card, and dice games have long been the mainstay of the gaming table. So far, excepting some experimental board games, digital games have not found much of a home at this venue, probably because of their reliance on vertical screens. As touch screens grow cheaper and larger, and augmented reality glasses enter the marketplace, it is entirely possible that a whole new world of digital games will come into the table games venue.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec3_4_2"><span class="pd_orange">The Playground</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">As adults who are excited about games, we can sometimes forget that play is largely the domain of children. And while children like to play in different ways in the home and they sometimes enjoy the formality of playing sports in arena-like venues, they also like to play out-of-doors with their friends. When we hear the world &#8220;playground&#8221; our first thought is often of play equipment at public parks. And while that is one sort of playground, any space where children gather for improvisational play, be it a backyard, a street, a vacant lot, or a cave in the woods, is a kind of playground.</p>
<p class="indent">Playground play is easy for adults to forget about, because we mostly don&#8217;t play that way anymore. But children always will, and they must&#8212;it is an important part of their development. The video game industry has largely ignored playground play so far, because it hasn&#8217;t been feasible for them to create games that work there&#8212;but as technology becomes more rugged and more mobile, that will likely change.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec3_4_3"><span class="pd_orange">Anywhere</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Some games don&#8217;t really care where they are played. Crossword puzzles, Sudoku, and Word Find games are classic paper examples of &#8220;play anywhere&#8221; games, which can be very useful on the bus or when you have a few spare minutes at work or school. Of course, the explosion of smartphone games has changed the anywhere venue forever, creating a vastly richer set of games that can be played anywhere, at any time. However, it is worth noting that these games, due to their interruptibility and small screen size, have some distinct qualities. They tend to be playable in tiny bites, and they tend to have very simple interfaces and stories. Additionally, because they are just filling a few minutes here and there during one&#8217;s day, players are generally not willing to pay very much for them up front, preferring them to be free if possible. In <a class="nounder" href="C35_chapter32.xhtml#chapter32">Chapter 32</a>: <a class="nounder" href="C35_chapter32.xhtml#chapter32"><i>Profit</i></a>, we&#8217;ll talk more about the specifics of these games and the peculiarities of their business models.</p>

<p class="noindent">It&#8217;s easy to find gaps and overlaps in this system of venues. What venue am I in when I play a game of pinball at a restaurant? What venue is a bowling alley? Is a casino a museum, an arena, a collection of table games, or something else entirely? The Nintendo Switch is a remarkable platform because it works well in the Hearth, the Reading Nook, the Gaming Table, and even Anywhere. The important thing isn&#8217;t to have a perfect taxonomy of venues; the important thing is to see past the games and platforms so that you are aware of the venues and their properties, because while games and technologies change constantly, venues change very little. To that end, here is a lens to help you see the truth.</p>
<p class="indent">Now that we&#8217;ve talked about experiences and where they take place, we need to confront a more troubling question. What exactly makes a game a game?</p>
<aside class="boxed-text" epub:type="tip" role="doc-tip" id="box3">
<h2 class="box-title"><a href="C02b_tol.xhtml#rbox3"><span class="pd_whitez">#3 The Lens of the Venue</span></a></h2>
<p class="noindent">The places that we play exert tremendous influence on the design of our games. To make sure you aren&#8217;t designing in a vacuum, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list">What type of venue best suits the game I&#8217;m trying to create?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Does my venue have special properties that will influence my game?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">What elements of my game are in harmony with my venue? What elements are not?</p></li>
