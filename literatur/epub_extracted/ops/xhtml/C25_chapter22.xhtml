<p class="noindent"><span id="p412" aria-label=" page 412. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>How do you know that your surroundings are real, and not an illusion? We are presented with illusions all day long&#8230; photographs, videos, even 3D movies. Videos and movies, especially, have a power to pull in our consciousness, and fully engage our minds. But, as engrossing as they may be, and as realistic as they may look, we are never fooled into thinking they are real, in a real place with us, because we can see and feel that our bodies are not in the same place as the images we look upon. We might project our minds into these experiences, but we never project our bodies. But at night, we go to sleep, and dream. And in our dreams, we are presented with another set of illusions. Despite their many gaps in logic we accept them in the moment as real, so real that sometimes we wake with a smile of delight on our lips, or with a shout of dismay in our throats. The illusions of dreams are different than most waking illusions. In dreams, not only do we experience rich sights and sounds (all without using our eyes and ears), but we experience smell, taste, and touch, and something more. In dreams, even our bodies seem to be present in the illusions our minds create, and as a result, we believe the places and events we dream are real.</p>
<p class="indent">People tend to think of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) as technologies designed to fool the eye. But it might be more correct to say that these are technologies designed to fool the body. Well, not the body itself, but rather the mind&#8217;s sense of the body. The technical term for this sense is &#8220;proprioception,&#8221; a word coined from Latin in 1906, meaning &#8220;a sense of one&#8217;s self,&#8221; and it is a very powerful sense. The relationship between our body and the world is how we define much of our identity, and how we decide what is and isn&#8217;t real. The expression &#8220;pinch me, I must be dreaming&#8221; is an expression of the idea that my eyes and mind might be fooled by illusions, but what happens to my body is real.</p>
<p class="indent">The true magic of VR and AR is not simply 3D images. Those have been around since the invention of the stereoscope in 1838. No, the magic of VR and AR is that they let us bring our bodies into the world of the simulation. And this is important, because, surprisingly, we do a lot of thinking not just with our brains, but with our bodies. Traditional games (children&#8217;s games, athletic games, party games) frequently involve the body, but most digital games try to involve the body as little as possible. The twitching tips of your fingers are the only part of the body most videogames acknowledge. But bodily presence is a real thing. VR developers see it most in the unconscious behaviors of players in their worlds. A VR player who is trying to solve a puzzle, and has to stop and think will often casually lean on a virtual table or counter, only to suddenly realize that it isn&#8217;t real and they are in danger of falling over. Of course, they never intellectually believed that the virtual table was real, but some subconscious part of their mind found the presentation of the immersive 3D world realistic enough that it was prepared to treat virtual objects as real ones. This feeling of presence, not well understood by psychology, is the central magic of VR.</p>
<p class="indent">But what about AR? There is much debate about which will have the greatest impact on the game world: VR or AR? While at the time of this writing, VR seems to have the most promise for games, due to its ability to transport you to a fantasy world, it is common to hear people say, &#8220;I&#8217;m not interested in VR &#8211; what I really want is AR.&#8221; What they are really saying is that the idea of sending their body into a <span id="p413" aria-label=" page 413. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>virtual world is not appealing to them, that what they want is for simulated objects and entities to come to them, to have these things join them in the real world. And this is understandable&#8212;the idea of sending your body to another place is exciting to some, but can make others feel uncomfortable and vulnerable. Not only could the fantasy place be weird or scary, but losing track of your body in the real world, as your mind focuses on a virtual world instead, is a disturbing concept. One could say that AR experiences are about bringing simulations &#8220;here&#8221; where my body is, and VR experiences are about sending my body &#8220;there&#8221; where the simulation is. Put both real/simulated and here/there on different axes, and you get a diagram showing four different ways of interfacing with reality:</p>

<p class="indent">Different play experiences, of course, are suited to different quadrants. To date, there have been very few games in the &#8220;telepresence&#8221; quadrant, but, who knows? Perhaps the day is coming when telepresence robots become common, opening up whole new categories of games.</p>
<p class="indent">As game designers, we make new realities all the time. Every simulation is a kind of new reality. It is worth thinking about some of the many kinds of reality that we can create:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list"><b>Logical Reality</b> defines the rules of cause and effect.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Spatial Reality</b> defines how I move through space.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Proprioceptive Reality</b> defines where it feels like my body is.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Social Reality</b> defines how I interact with others.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Previous chapters have talked a lot about creating compelling logical realities and spatial realities, and upcoming chapters will talk about social realities. But proprioceptive realities, created by the power of presence, are something very special, and <span id="p414" aria-label=" page 414. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>also worthy of our consideration. Presence might be more important than it seems. After all, some say that the secret to happiness is &#8220;to be present,&#8221; and some who meditate claim that by &#8220;being present&#8221; on a daily basis, the very meaning of life has unfolded before them.</p>
<section class="level3">
<h2 class="h3" id="sec22_1"><span class="pd_orange">The Power of Presence</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">When a new medium appears, people copy things from the old one. When motion pictures were invented, people filmed stage plays, not realizing that cuts and editing would be the heart of the new medium. When Internet video was invented, people created expensive thirty- and sixty-minute programs for it, not realizing that short amateur videos were what people really wanted. And, similarly, now that VR and AR have appeared, many people are trying to copy what has worked in the worlds of console, PC, and mobile gaming, not realizing that the heart of VR and AR is something new. The heart of VR and AR is presence.</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec22_2"><span class="pd_orange">Six Presence Breakers</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Unfortunately, presence does not come for free with these technologies. Presence is a fragile illusion, a magician&#8217;s trick where one awkward interaction can spoil the whole effect. If you are going to design an experience centered on a feeling of presence, you must consider the disturbing notion that presence might be even more important than gameplay. Remember the Lens of the Toy? Players are glad to fiddle about with the elements of a world in which they feel presence, even if no gameplay is there. But if the presence is broken or interrupted, the player becomes very aware that they are in a headset, and may even become annoyed by the whole experience, no matter how good the gameplay actually is. This is inconceivable to many game developers, who believe wholeheartedly that gameplay comes first, no matter what. But, consider: if the very point of your VR or AR experience is that the player feels present in the virtual world, and that illusion of presence is broken, what experience are you providing? Those who spend time working in these new media come to realize how fragile an illusion presence really is, and how much effort must be expended to preserve it. To that end, here are six of the greatest dangers to the feeling of presence.</p>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec22_2_1"><span class="pd_orange">Presence Breaker #1: Motion Sickness</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">When you think about it, the phenomenon of motion sickness is incredibly strange. A person is confronted with unusual motion (say, that of a boat, car, or roller coaster), or the appearance of motion (say, an IMAX movie, or a VR car race), and their body <span id="p415" aria-label=" page 415. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>responds by becoming gradually more nauseous, and possibly, ultimately vomiting. Why vomiting? Why not sneezing, or getting chills, or feeling tingly, or any other number of possible physiological responses? Why any response at all? The answer is known as the &#8220;toxicology hypothesis.&#8221; Certain poisons (from some mushrooms, for example) can disrupt the neurology of the brain such that the input from the little hairs in our inner ear (which detect acceleration and rotation) do not align with the input from our visual system. These poisons must have been a significant problem sometime in our evolutionary past, because wise old nature has programmed our brains to vomit when this happens, saving our lives. The problem is that poisons are not the only way to cause this disconnect&#8212;reading in the car, riding the Tilt-a-Whirl, and engaging in certain VR experiences can do the same thing. AR experiences, at present, are less likely to cause motion sickness, because they are less likely to give false information to the outer edges of our visual field, which is what the brain uses to register motion. But, as AR technology advances with a wider field of view, it too will be able to trigger this neurological poison control mechanism.</p>
<p class="indent">Can we disrupt this mechanism somehow? Certain drugs (Dramamine, for example) do just that, but as Spalding Gray once noted about using drugs to disable specific brain activities, &#8220;there is no such thing as precision bombing,&#8221; and these drugs tend to make players feel drowsy and disconnected. One day (around 2060 or so, by my guess), we&#8217;ll probably have some kind of nanotechnology that can safely calm our motion sickness circuit without side effects, but until then, we have to live with it. Exactly what triggers motion sickness differs vastly from person to person, but it is possible to create great experiences with no &#8220;motion discomfort&#8221; by following these tips.</p>
<ol class="list-order">
<li><p class="list"><b>Keep the framerate up</b>. Consider 60 frames per second (fps) your new absolute acceptable minimum. 90&#8201;fps or more should be your goal. Yes, I know this is hard. Yes, I know that hardware platforms are variable. I don&#8217;t care. Your head and eyes can move quite fast, and when you are much below these high frame rates, your brain starts to sense something is wrong. Some people disagree, insisting that the brain can&#8217;t even detect the differences between such high frame rates&#8212;that film has established that 24&#8201;fps is plenty. If you feel this way, try this experiment. Go out under a fluorescent streetlight one night, and toss a ball in the air. The streetlight is pulsing at 50&#8211;60 times a second. If you just look at the light, it seems to be continuously on. But if you look at the ball, you can clearly see the individual light pulses. But you don&#8217;t even have to go outside. Pick up your PC mouse and shake it back and forth, and watch your cursor. Your screen is likely updating at 60 fps&#8212;and you can clearly see the discrete positions. The way the brain perceives motion is not simple or easy. In the new world of VR, frame rates below 60&#8201;fps are no longer feasible.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Avoid virtual camera movement</b>. I know. You want to make a first person shooter, you want to make a racing game, you want to have a dogfight in space. All of these require a virtual camera that whizzes all over the place while the <span id="p416" aria-label=" page 416. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>real camera (the player&#8217;s eye) stays still. Well, guess what? Any time you create a disconnect between the eye and those little hairs in the inner ear, your player can become nauseated. So, yes, that means a lot of kinds of gameplay are off the table. Keep in mind, though, that for everything that VR takes away, it gives something new that couldn&#8217;t be done before. Being able to move your head and body through an environment, even for a short distance, is an incredible experience, as is manipulating virtual objects with your real hands. It requires some creativity to design within the bounds of the VR box, but if you are willing to do it, you can create powerful experiences that have just about zero motion sickness. This isn&#8217;t to say that VR experiences with spatial motion are off the table&#8212;it just means that you take a risk when you create them, and you must work extra hard to give your players a comfortable experience.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>If you must move the camera, don&#8217;t accelerate</b>. Funny thing about those little hairs in your ears&#8212;they can only detect acceleration, not velocity. They can&#8217;t tell the difference between zipping down the highway at 80 miles per hour, and sitting perfectly still. What they notice is speeding up and slowing down. When I coded up the locomotion system for <i>Aladdin&#8217;s Magic Carpet VR Adventure</i> at DisneyQuest in the late nineties, I took advantage of this fact by programming the motion of the carpet to be as linear as possible. Some amount of acceleration was necessary, though, and as a result, some motion sickness was inevitable. It was very limited, however, because the experience is on a five-minute timer, and most people can endure five minutes of mild virtual motion without much discomfort. For home play, however, five minutes is generally not an acceptable duration. It is not uncommon for home players to want to keep playing VR experiences for over an hour at a time, and motion sickness can have a cumulative effect.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Hide the edges</b>. Have you ever been sitting on a bus or train, and suddenly had a feeling of motion, only to look up and realize that your vehicle is not moving at all, but rather the one next to you is? The reason for this sensation of motion is that our brain uses the edges of our visual field to decide how we are moving. Clever VR developers have realized that if they hide the edges of the visual field with what is commonly called a &#8220;vignette&#8221; they can significantly reduce feelings of motion discomfort. The first commercial game to use this technique was <i>Eagle&#8217;s Flight</i>. This technique is not a cure-all, as there are times when it can distract players, thus breaking presence. But use it at the right time, such as when players are intensely focused on moving toward a specific location, and players don&#8217;t even notice it is there.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Teleport sparingly</b>. Since virtual motion can cause motion sickness, an obvious choice of travel is teleportation&#8212;it gets you there quickly, and causes no motion sickness&#8212;perfect, right? Unfortunately, no. Surprisingly, teleportation can be a significant presence breaker. It seems the way your mind creates the illusion of presence is by building a mental 3D model of the space around you. But it can only do this if you have looked at that space. It is a subtle thing, but each <span id="p417" aria-label=" page 417. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>time you press that teleport button, you take yourself to place where you have no presence, and you won&#8217;t get the presence back until you spend time looking at your surroundings. So, while teleportation does prevent motion sickness, experientially it saps away presence, the very thing we most need to preserve. To paraphrase <i>Doctor Who</i>, it is a cheap and nasty form of space travel.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>And whatever you do, keep the horizon level</b>. Certain kinds of motion, virtual or real, are shortcuts to trigger your motion sickness alarm circuit. Rolling the camera in a &#8220;barrel roll&#8221; style, so that the horizon does cartwheels in front of the player&#8217;s eyes, is the quickest shortcut to nausea city. So&#8212;don&#8217;t do that. The canals in your inner ear that control all this are circular and very good at detecting rotation, so, generally, you should avoid virtual rotation (where the camera rotates separately from the player&#8217;s head) of any kind. Part of what makes VR unique is that it lets players really turn around&#8212;for real! Use real rotation to let players look around an environment, and avoid virtual rotation whenever possible.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">It is very important to take the problem of motion sickness seriously. Not only can it disrupt the experience you are so lovingly trying to create, it can have much more far reaching effects. Most people have had a traumatic experience with some food that makes them nauseous, only to find that years and decades later, the sight or thought of that food still makes them physically ill. The mind takes poison control very seriously, and if your players&#8217; subconscious minds come to believe that your games are toxic, players will avoid them for the rest of their lives, because they get sick to their stomach just thinking about them.</p>

<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec22_2_2"><span class="pd_orange">Presence Breaker #2: Counter-Intuitive Interactions</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Of course, in any game we create, we want interactions to be clear and intuitive, but in VR, the stakes are much higher. A physical interaction that is confusing or counter-intuitive will break presence in an instant. And in VR, the importance of player interactions matching reality is much higher than in a screen-based game. For example, in a traditional adventure game, objects are often uni-taskers: screwdrivers are for unscrewing and nothing else. Knives are for cutting and nothing else. It is a sort of &#8220;key and lock&#8221; mentality. But when the phenomenon of presence takes over, and your body thinks the virtual world is real, a great deal more richness of interaction is expected. At Schell Games, we developed a spy-themed VR game called <i>I Expect You To Die</i> that contains a puzzle where you need to unscrew a panel from a car&#8217;s console. We placed screwdrivers within sight, which we fully expected players to use for this purpose. However, we found many players tried to unscrew the panel using a pocketknife they found in a glovebox. This surprised us, because we were thinking about this too much like a traditional presence-free adventure game. Our players, on the other hand, who were experiencing presence felt that since they might use a knife as a screwdriver in the real world, it seemed perfectly <span id="p418" aria-label=" page 418. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>natural to do so in the game. Initially, this silently failed, and it was a real immersion breaker. Allowing players to unscrew the panel with a knife would require us to radically change our puzzle structure, so ultimately we added a dialogue line from our narrator: &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen you do many creative things with a knife, but I don&#8217;t think turning screws will be among them.&#8221; This is kind of a cop out, and still a mild presence breaker, but at least it acknowledges the player&#8217;s attempt, and asks them to move on to something else. Other interactions we handled better: shooting the champagne bottle with the gun shatters it, and the broken glass can be used to cut things. Lighting the money on fire with the lighter causes it to burn. Players love using objects on other objects&#8212;if you can handle these interactions realistically, you will delight them. If you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll remind them this is &#8220;just a game,&#8221; and break their presence. The only way to find these deep interactions is through repetitive playtesting. It is much wiser to create a small game with rich, natural object interactions than a big game with weak ones that will destroy presence.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec22_2_3"><span class="pd_orange">Presence Breaker #3: Intensity Overload</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Many players crave thrill and intense action&#8212;these are important pleasures in games. And VR is a powerful way to deliver these things. But some designers fail to realize how much more intense VR can be. We have a special nucleus in our brain that is responsible for paying attention to objects that come close to our bodies. Ask someone to put their hand near your face (it doesn&#8217;t work with your own hand), and you can feel that nucleus turn on. Traditional videogames cannot activate that nucleus, but VR and AR can. Many of our greatest fears involve bad things happening to our bodies, and VR can be used to make players feel like these things are really happening! VR can make you feel like your body is falling from a great height, like you are drowning, like bees are swarming around you, like creepy monsters are touching you. These things can be thrilling and exciting, but they can also be so overwhelming that people want to rip off the headset and stop the experience. The moment someone thinks &#8220;this is too much &#8211; I want this to stop,&#8221; you have already lost them, because their inner voice is quietly repeating, like a parent to a child, &#8220;it&#8217;s only pretend&#8230; it&#8217;s only pretend&#8230;&#8221; which means your player&#8217;s mind is actively fighting against the presence you are trying so carefully to create.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec22_2_4"><span class="pd_orange">Presence Breaker #4: Unrealistic Audio</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">If I pick up a virtual coin and hold it in my hand, turning it over to look at front and back, I might be really immersed in what I&#8217;m doing if it looks realistic. But if I then drop it, and it makes no sound, I&#8217;ll be reminded that the world is fake, and my presence is destroyed. If instead, it makes realistic &#8220;ping&#8221; and &#8220;ching&#8221; noises as it bounces around on the cobblestone street, my presence will be maintained. <span id="p419" aria-label=" page 419. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Sound is closely related to touch, and so your mind uses your sense of sound to decide where your body is. Put another way, hearing is believing.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec22_2_5"><span class="pd_orange">Presence Breaker #5: Proprioceptive Disconnect</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Proprioception is more than your sense of where your body is located, it also is your sense of how your body is positioned; your awareness that you are sitting or standing, for example, or that one foot is crossed over the other. In a screen-based videogame, our proprioceptive sense is irrelevant. In VR, making our real and virtual bodies match is key to maintaining presence. If you are seated while playing a VR game that involves your character walking about a room, your body perceives it as fake, and presence is broken. The scale alone is confusing to your body: if your physical body is seated, but your virtual head is six feet off the ground, your body and mind can perceive either that you are floating, or that the world is very small, for, even though you are looking at tall adults eye to eye, your body knows that if you stood up, you&#8217;d be the equivalent of eight feet tall! Your mind knows this isn&#8217;t possible, so it can create the strange feeling that everything around you is small.</p>
<p class="indent">Another type of proprioceptive disconnect involves objects penetrating the player&#8217;s body&#8212;walking through a virtual table, for example. Players do not like having their bodies penetrated by virtual objects. It feels disconcerting at first, as your mind and body struggle in subconscious fear, but soon it simply breaks presence. The fastest way to bring about a proprioceptive disconnect is to give players awkward virtual bodies that they can see. If visual sense of your body differs from your proprioceptive sense (those fake hands or feet aren&#8217;t positioned where your real ones are) your mind quickly rejects the reality as fake. Much better to show no body (your brain doesn&#8217;t mind this much, for some reason) than a body slightly out of place. Consider this the uncanny valley of VR avatars.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec22_2_6"><span class="pd_orange">Presence Breaker #6: Lack of Identity</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Presence is the pervasive sense of being somewhere. But to be somewhere you must be some<i>one</i>. Presence and identity are closely entwined. VR filmmakers often fail to understand this. If someone make a screen-based movie of two people talking at a table, and we watch it, it seems quite normal. We are used to screen-based media being a sort of floating eye that flits around scenes invisible to the actors. But if the same movie is filmed with VR, suddenly your body is present, and you start to wonder, &#8220;Why are these two people ignoring me? Can&#8217;t they see I&#8217;m right here?&#8221; and of course, your presence in the world immediately makes you wonder about your identity in the world. Failing to address the question of the player&#8217;s identity will be a nagging reminder to the player that they aren&#8217;t really there.</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec22_3"><span id="p420" aria-label=" page 420. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="pd_orange">Six Presence Builders</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">While it is very important to remove all the presence breakers that you can from your experience, it is not enough. Presence doesn&#8217;t just happen. Like starting a fire with only flint and tinder, presence must be patiently fostered and encouraged. These six techniques can help.</p>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec22_3_1"><span class="pd_orange">Presence Builder #1: Hand Presence</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Because VR and AR are technologies of the body, and not just the eyes, the way we use our bodies during these experiences is very important. And the main way that humans interact with the world is with their hands. Remember our definition of play? &#8220;Manipulation that satisfies curiosity.&#8221; The very word &#8220;manipulate&#8221; comes from the Latin word &#8220;manus,&#8221; which means hand. There is something about seeing one&#8217;s own hands that is very special. &#8220;Lucid dreaming&#8221; is the name for the unusual experience of realizing you are dreaming, yet continuing to experience your dream. This is hard for most of us, for when we realize we are dreaming, our dreams tend to quickly fade. When avid lucid dreamers realize they are dreaming, a common technique they use to stabilize the dream state is to stare at their dream hand. Something about seeing one&#8217;s own hand seems to convince the mind that the world is solid and real. Similarly, there is a world of difference between VR and AR experiences that involve just looking at a world, and those where you can reach out and touch it. The effect is so strong that VR developers often refer to the power of &#8220;hand presence.&#8221; Hand tracking of some kind is a must for hand presence to happen, but it is not enough. The strongest and best hand presence occurs when the player is able to meaningfully and naturally manipulate the environment around them. This requires a lot of thoughtful design, and a deep understanding of the relationship between the mind and the hands. For example, when using a tool, the mind no longer thinks of the hands&#8212;the mind goes to the tip of the tool the hands are holding. Savvy VR designers have realized that this means it is acceptable to make hands invisible when a tool is in use. Can you name which VR experiences do and don&#8217;t use this technique? Most players can&#8217;t remember, because they simply don&#8217;t notice their hands have become invisible.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4">
<h3 class="h4" id="sec22_3_2"><span class="pd_orange">Presence Builder #2: Social Presence</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Humans are social creatures, and a significant amount of our brain is dedicated to processing human faces and gestures. VR and AR have the power to create a special kind of telecommunication, one that feels more natural than a screen-based video call, because of the feeling of presence of another person. Being able to speak and gesture naturally with someone else in VR and AR is a very special experience, one that will become quite common when the number of connected headsets rises over <span id="p421" aria-label=" page 421. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>ten million. Even a simple audio phone call creates a form of presence, as you feel you are in a sort of social space with that remote person. The presence created by making eye contact and seeing the gestures and movements of another person in the same space with me goes a long way to making a space, and that person, seem real&#8230; and if we can hand objects back and forth, all the better.</p>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec22_3_3"><span class="pd_orange">Presence Builder #3: Familiarity</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Remember how we said that in order to feel presence, you must look around your environment so that your mind can build an internal 3D model of it? That is only true when you are in an unfamiliar place. If a familiar location is presented to you, such as a car interior, a fast food counter, or a basketball court, if these types of places are already familiar to you, your brain will fill out the details without you even looking, building presence quite quickly. As we&#8217;ve discussed, novelty in games is very important&#8212;but giving the right amount of familiarity, especially in your immediate surroundings, can give a feeling of presence that is surprisingly strong.</p>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec22_3_4"><span class="pd_orange">Presence Builder #4: Realistic Audio</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Whatever amount of sound design and integration you normally do on a game, expect to double it for a VR experience, because so much more sound design effort is required to make interactions with objects seem realistic. Partly this is because spatialized sound (the illusion that sounds are coming from a particular location) is powerful and important in VR, but also because realistic sound is very contextual. Sounds echo differently in a small room than they do in a large one. Collision sounds are especially contextual. Dropping a coin on a wooden table sounds very different than dropping it onto a glass one. In a screen-based videogame, the difference might go unnoticed&#8212;but in VR, getting these details right does a huge amount to build up presence.</p>

<h3 class="h4" id="sec22_3_5"><span class="pd_orange">Presence Builder #5: Proprioceptive Alignment</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Proprioceptive disconnects degrade presence, but proprioceptive alignment, where your real-life body and virtual body are strongly aligned, does a great deal to build presence. In <i>I Expect You To Die</i>, we designed the game for seated players, and so we developed seated scenarios (sitting at a desk, sitting in a car) and it did a great deal to strengthen presence. Many games have been experimenting with novel ways to give strong proprioceptive alignment, such as archery games where your arrows are stored in a quiver on your back. In order to get a new arrow, you must reach over your shoulder and grab it&#8212;a very natural and proprioceptively aligned action. As technologies improve, and foot and full-body tracking become the norm, proprioceptive alignment will be even more important, and lead to even stronger presence.</p>

<p class="noindent">It sounds strange, but it is much easier to build presence in a comedic world than in a serious world. The success of <i>Job Simulator</i>, an early VR title all about doing silly tasks in various workplace environments, illustrates the point. In a cartoonish comedy world, you don&#8217;t expect everything to work right. In fact, discovering the crazy rules of the world is part of the delight! In an early version of <i>Job Simulator</i>, a kitchen scene presented players with a knife, and some vegetables. Naturally, players wanted to cut the vegetables. This would be a technically challenging scene to develop, because arbitrarily sized geometry would have to be created with each cut. The developers avoided that problem by allowing something strange to happen. If players tried to cut the vegetables, the knife would unexpectedly shatter into pieces, providing a weird comic moment, and avoiding the problem. In a serious world, this would break presence, because it is so obviously unlike the real world. But in a comedy world, weird events like this only serve to reinforce the rules of this strange world, thus reinforcing the player&#8217;s sense of presence.</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec22_4"><span class="pd_orange">Encourage Looking Around</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">As noted as far back as 1996 in Randy Pausch&#8217;s study of <i>Disney&#8217;s Aladdin Magic Carpet VR Adventure</i>, players new to VR are hesitant to turn their heads and look around. This seems to be because most of us have a lifetime of training that screen-based media is best enjoyed by sitting still and facing forward. On top of that, creating media that requires players to look around their environment is a bit of a subtle art form that many VR designers do not get right. Further, many early VR experiences with low (&lt;60&#8201;fps) frame rates trained players to keep their heads still if they wanted to avoid motion sickness.</p>
<p class="indent">Giving the players reasons to look around is critical, as that helps build presence, as the mind builds a 3D model of the space. New players will not be inclined to do so at first. Gradually, though, you can lead them to it. <i>I Expect You To Die</i> does this by putting players into a place where they don&#8217;t expect to move around freely. If your players can navigate forward, they want to look forward. If you hold them in place, they eventually start to look around. One level of <i>I Expect You To Die</i> takes place in a parked car. The player is sitting in the driver&#8217;s seat. Initially, they examine what is in front of them&#8212;the steering wheel, the gas and brake pedals. When these don&#8217;t do anything, the player gradually starts to explore the car: the gearshift, the glove box, the passenger seat, and eventually they wonder what is in the back seat. Most players, once they start to explore the car, are startled at how real the world seems. This appears to be familiarity and looking around working together to build a sense of presence. If, instead, this were a game about driving a car, I am doubtful that the presence would arrive so quickly (though motion sickness likely would).</p>
<p class="indent">Not only do you need to give players reasons to look around (and interesting things to look at and interact with), but you would be wise to give players an <span id="p423" aria-label=" page 423. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>opportunity to look into things. Designers, wanting to be helpful, have a tendency to make everything easily visible from the player&#8217;s starting point. But keep in mind the power of positional tracking. In our game, we gave players lots of reasons not just to turn, but to move their heads. Multiple glove boxes, items in the back seat, fine print, physics that allows objects to fall onto the floor of the car, and even an retinal scanning system that demands you lean forward (and then tries to kill you with a laser if you don&#8217;t move your head out of the way) were all different ways we encouraged players to move their heads around in the environment.</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec22_5"><span class="pd_orange">Consider Brownboxing</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Most developers understand that when you undertake a game project with a lot of unknowns, you have to leave a lot of time in the schedule to deal with discoveries and problems. VR and AR projects have a lot of unknowns, and necessarily require time for experimentation and adaptation. But, here&#8217;s the funny thing: since you are trying to simulate reality, you can actually learn a lot by building your experience&#8230; in reality! Shawn Patton pioneered the technique of &#8220;brownboxing,&#8221; that is, using a bunch of old cardboard boxes to simulate a VR scene in the real world, and then playtesting it the way you would any paper playtest, having someone act as the game master, and telling you what happens as you touch, pick up, or manipulate different objects. You can&#8217;t test everything that way, but you can learn a lot quickly about how the player wants to interact with the scene using their hands, and what they can reach. Once your brownbox iteration is complete, measure it, hand it to the modeler, and you&#8217;ll have an excellent basis for your first &#8220;whiteboxed&#8221; digital prototype.</p>

<p class="noindent">The VR and AR inputs that you use very much define the experience you create. Systems that simply use a gamepad are very different from ones that use motion-tracked hand controllers, which are very different from ones that track your empty hands. Systems that require standing still create very different experiences from ones that give players the freedom to walk around. On top of all this, there are radical differences in the amount of processing power, how audio is delivered, and many other factors.</p>
<p class="indent">It will be the rare VR experience that can easily be ported to the variety of different VR input systems. As a result, if you want to create a great VR experience, you should first choose the input system you plan to use, and design your game around that. Yes, this will mean your game may be hard to port to other platforms, but it will be <i>great</i> on the platform you have chosen.</p>

<p class="indent">At the time of this writing (2019), VR and AR systems are only beginning to be treated as serious game platforms. By writing this chapter, I take a risk that what I say here may all sound foolish within a few years. However, I decided that these were ideas that are important to share with you, because while it is unlikely that VR and AR systems will become the dominant form of videogame hardware, the powerful experience of presence that they provide makes me certain that they will <span id="p425" aria-label=" page 425. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>have a permanent and important place in the world of game design. And though their forms and technology will evolve and change rapidly, I am confident that the importance of presence in these platforms will remain constant.</p>
<p class="indent">Given that presence is so influenced by the look and feel of your experience, this might be a good time to talk about aesthetics.</p>
