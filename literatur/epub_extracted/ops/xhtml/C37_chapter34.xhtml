<h2 class="h3" id="sec34_1"><span class="pd_orange">The Danger of Obscurity</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">You should be prepared to understand that as a game designer, you are not going to get a lot of respect. If you manage to find a way to design games professionally, you can expect a lot of conversations like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="speech">Friend of a friend: So, what do you do?</p>
<p class="speech">You: I design videogames.</p>
<p class="speech">Friend of a friend (clearly uncomfortable): Oh&#8230; so, like that <i>Grand Theft Auto</i>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent"><span id="p569" aria-label=" page 569. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>It&#8217;s the same as if everyone who makes films were asked, &#8220;Oh&#8230; so, you&#8217;re a pornographer?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">But you really can&#8217;t blame people. There is a lot of lurid material in the world of videogames, and lurid stories always get the most press. Slowly, this will surely change, as games become more and more mainstream. But even as it does, and it becomes less embarrassing to be a game designer, it will continue to be a profession where it is difficult to become famous, well known, or respected. Screenwriters have the same problem: people generally don&#8217;t care who makes the things they like, and the publishers would rather you didn&#8217;t become famous anyway, because it makes you expensive. But I&#8217;m not complaining about this&#8212;I am only mentioning it to point out something quite dangerous: Because you will be able to work in relative obscurity, no one is going to ask you to take responsibility for what you create.</p>
<p class="indent">And you might say, &#8220;It&#8217;s not my name on the line, it&#8217;s the name of the publisher, and they&#8217;re so worried about getting sued, I&#8217;m sure they won&#8217;t let anything out the door that would hurt anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">But are you sure? Corporations make mistakes all the time. And further, corporations have no ethical responsibility. Sure, they have to follow the law, but beyond that, their sole and single purpose is to generate money, and ethics don&#8217;t enter into it, because corporations have no souls. Bank accounts, yes, legal responsibility, yes, but not souls&#8212;and that means no ethical responsibility. Only individuals can take ethical responsibility. Are you going to assume that game company managers are going to take on that kind of personal responsibility? They might, but you and I know they probably won&#8217;t. No, there is only one person who can take responsibility for what you create, and that is you.</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec34_2"><span class="pd_orange">Being Accountable</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">In <a class="nounder" href="C36_chapter33.xhtml#chapter33">Chapter 33</a>: <a class="nounder" href="C36_chapter33.xhtml#chapter33"><i>Transform</i></a>, we talked about some ways that games might be dangerous. And as new technologies arrive, there are also new ways for games to accidentally do harm. Of all the dangers that games might or might not contain, the one that is most real and undeniable for players of online games is the potential to meet with dangerous strangers. When most people think about making their online game &#8220;safe,&#8221; they think about making sure that children aren&#8217;t exposed to foul language. But while foul language may be inappropriate, it has nothing to do with safety. No, the real danger is the fact that online games can be a mask of anonymity that dangerous people can use to take advantage of innocents. If you are designing a game that involves strangers talking to each other, you must take responsibility for what that might lead to. This is one of the rare cases where your choices in game design could cause lives to be saved or lost. You might think there is a one in a million chance of something dangerous happening in your game, but if that is true, <span id="p570" aria-label=" page 570. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and your game is so successful that five million people play it, that dangerous thing will happen five times.</p>
<p class="indent">Many designers decide that they cannot be held responsible for what happens in their game, and they leave it to the lawyers to decide what is and is not safe. But are you content to leave your ethical responsibility in the hands of corporate lawyers? If you aren&#8217;t willing to take personal responsibility for the games you make, you shouldn&#8217;t be making them. I worked on one project where the team felt so strongly about this, we asked our concept artist to create an image of what the cover of <i>Time</i> magazine would look like the week a child was abducted due to a lack of communication safeguards in our game. We never showed it outside the team, but every one of us burned this image into our minds to help us remember the responsibility that was on our shoulders.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3">
<h2 class="h3" id="sec34_3"><span class="pd_orange">Your Hidden Agenda</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">But you might argue that your game really is safe&#8212;there is no way it could do harm. And you might be right. Consider this: Is it possible you could find a way for your game to do good? To somehow make people&#8217;s lives better? If you know this is possible, and you choose not to do it, isn&#8217;t that, in a way, just as bad as making a game that harms people?</p>
<p class="indent">Now, don&#8217;t get me wrong&#8212;I&#8217;m not the type who is going to tell you that it is the responsibility of game companies to better the human race, even if it means losing some profits. The only responsibility of a game company is to make money. The responsibility for making games do good lies solely with you. Am I saying that you should try to convince management that your title will be better if it can somehow improve mankind? I am not. Management won&#8217;t care about that&#8212;their job is to serve the corporation, and the corporation only cares about making money.</p>
<p class="indent">What I am telling you is that, if you want to, you can design your games so that they will improve people&#8217;s lives, but you will probably need to do this in secret. Generally, it will not serve you well to tell management about how it is important to you that you use the powerful medium of games to help people, because if they know that is your goal, they will think your priorities are out of whack. But they aren&#8217;t. For if you make a game that is really good for people, but no one likes it (the game version of a broccoli smoothie), you haven&#8217;t helped anyone. The only way your games can serve humanity is if as many people play them as possible. The trick is to figure out what you can put into your best-selling games that will transform players for the better. You might think this impossible&#8212;that people only like what is bad for them. But it isn&#8217;t true. One thing people like better than almost anything else is being cared for. And if you can manage, through your game, to make your players into better people, they will feel, appreciate, and remember that rare feeling that someone else cares what they become.</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec34_4"><span id="p571" aria-label=" page 571. " epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="pd_orange">The Secret Hidden in Plain Sight</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Is it overkill to put this much consideration into the effect that games have on people? It is not. Games are not just trivial amusements. Games are a means of creating experiences, and life itself is composed of nothing but experiences. Moreover, the experiences that game designers create aren&#8217;t everyday experiences&#8212;they are ones where people live out their fantasies and strive to become what they have always secretly wished to be. Fantasy worlds created for children become modern mythology&#8212;shared story worlds that stay with them as a guiding compass for the rest of their lives. We create utopias: ideal societies to which all nations are compared.</p>
<p class="indent">It is not enough to think of how games affect people today&#8212;we must consider how they will affect people tomorrow. You are working in, and inventing, the medium that will subsume all others. The medium that a person is immersed in when they are young defines how they will think for their entire lives. As you continue to invent and improve the medium of games, you are defining the thought process of the next generation. This is no trivial matter.</p>
<p class="indent">When you think about it, is there any human activity that cannot be viewed as a game, and therefore benefit from the principles of good game design?</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="sec34_5"><span class="pd_orange">The Ring</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Have you ever thought about your pinky? How it is strangely smaller than all the other fingers? It almost seems like an accident&#8212;like some kind of withered appendage. But it isn&#8217;t. It has a purpose that most of us are completely unaware of. Your pinky guides your hand. Every time you pick something up or put something down on a surface, your pinky is there first, feeling things out like a little antenna and safely guiding the hand into position.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1922, Rudyard Kipling was asked by the University of Toronto to create a ritual to help remind graduating engineers of their obligation to help society. At the conclusion of this solemn ritual, still practiced today, the engineer is given an iron ring, placed on the pinky finger of their dominant hand, as a lifelong reminder of this obligation.</p>
<p class="indent">One day, game designers may concoct their own ritual of obligation, but you don&#8217;t have time to wait for that. Your obligation begins today&#8212;this minute. If you truly believe that games can help people, then, here&#8212;take this ring. It is invisible, like mine&#8212;that way, you can&#8217;t lose it. If you are willing to accept the responsibilities that go along with being a game designer, then you should put it on. Wear it as a reminder to let these responsibilities guide your hand. Think about it carefully before you put the ring on, though, because it doesn&#8217;t come off. Oh&#8212;and if you look closely, you&#8217;ll see it bears this inscription:</p>
