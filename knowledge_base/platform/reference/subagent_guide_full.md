# Sub-Agents Guide
## Specialized Analysis Through Isolated Context

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-12

---

## Overview

Sub-agents are specialized AI assistants spawned via the Task tool for specific analysis or design tasks. They operate in **separate context windows**, preserving the main coordinator's context while providing deep domain expertise.

### Why Sub-Agents?

**Problem:** Loading all domain contexts dilutes attention
```
Main Claude context:
✓ Physics docs (10k tokens)
✓ Economy docs (8k tokens)
✓ Security knowledge (12k tokens)
✓ Performance analysis (9k tokens)
✓ UX principles (7k tokens)
= 46k tokens → 70% rule adherence
```

**Solution:** Specialized sub-agents with focused context
```
Security Reviewer Sub-Agent:
✓ Security knowledge only (12k tokens)
✓ Current code to review (5k tokens)
= 17k tokens → 95% rule adherence
```

## Usage Patterns

### Spawning Sub-Agents

**From Coordinator Claude:**

```python
# Design Phase
design_result = Task(
    subagent_type="design_architect",
    description="Design speed boost powerup system",
    prompt="""
    Design a speed boost powerup for our game.

    Requirements:
    - Speed multiplier: 2x
    - Duration: 3 seconds
    - Cost: 50 DNA
    - Visual: Blue streak trail

    Affected systems: Physics, Economy, VFX, UI, Content

    Create comprehensive technical specification.
    """
)

# Review Phase (parallel)
security_result = Task(
    subagent_type="security_reviewer",
    description="Security audit of auth system",
    prompt="""
    Review the authentication system for security vulnerabilities.

    Files to review:
    - src/auth/login.ts
    - src/auth/jwt.ts
    - src/auth/session.ts

    Provide detailed security audit report.
    """
)

performance_result = Task(
    subagent_type="performance_reviewer",
    description="Performance analysis of rendering",
    prompt="""
    Analyze rendering performance of speed boost VFX.

    Target: Maintain 60fps on mid-range mobile devices.

    Provide performance analysis with metrics.
    """
)

# Validation Phase
validation_result = Task(
    subagent_type="validator",
    description="Final validation of speed boost feature",
    prompt="""
    Perform comprehensive validation of the speed boost powerup feature.

    Validate:
    - All tests passing

    - Security clean
    - Performance targets met
    - Documentation complete

    Return PASS/FAIL with detailed report.
    """
)
```

## Best Practices

### Do:

✅ **Keep prompts focused** - Clear task, specific files, concrete deliverables
✅ **Provide context** - What they need to know, where to look
✅ **Set expectations** - Word count, depth, format
✅ **Validate output** - Use SubagentStop hook to check quality
✅ **Reuse sub-agents** - Same agent type for similar tasks

### Don't:

❌ **Overload context** - Sub-agents have limited context, stay focused
❌ **Expect state retention** - Each invocation is fresh, no memory
❌ **Use for implementation** - Sub-agents are for analysis/design, not coding
❌ **Skip validation** - Always check sub-agent output quality
❌ **Ignore feedback** - If sub-agent asks questions, answer them

---

## Troubleshooting

### Sub-Agent Output Too Brief

**Problem:** Review is only 50 words, missing depth

**Solution:**
1. Check SubagentStop hook is configured
2. Add minimum word count to prompt: "Minimum 500 words"
3. Request specific elements: "Must include X, Y, Z"
4. Refine agent system prompt to emphasize thoroughness

### Sub-Agent Missing Context

**Problem:** Agent doesn't have information needed

**Solution:**
1. Specify files to read in prompt
2. Write temporary context file agent can read
3. Include key information in prompt directly
4. Adjust agent's tool permissions

### Sub-Agent Taking Too Long

**Problem:** Agent exceeds expected duration

**Solution:**
1. Narrow scope in prompt
2. Reduce files to analyze
3. Set timeout in Task call
4. Consider breaking into multiple sub-agents

---

## Advanced Topics

### Chaining Sub-Agents

```python
# Agent 1: Design
design = Task(subagent_type="design_architect", ...)

# Write design to file
Write("state/design_output.md", design.result)

# Agent 2: Review design
review = Task(
    subagent_type="code_quality_reviewer",
    prompt=f"""
    Review the technical design in state/design_output.md.
    Check for completeness, clarity, and feasibility.
    """
)

# Agent 3: Revise based on feedback
revised_design = Task(
    subagent_type="design_architect",
    prompt=f"""
    Revise the design based on this feedback:
    {review.result}

    Original design: state/design_output.md
    """
)
```

### Custom Sub-Agents

Create project-specific agents:

```markdown
---
name: Game Balance Simulator
description: Simulates game balance with Monte Carlo methods
tools: [Read, Bash]
---

# Your Role
You simulate game balance scenarios to validate mechanics.

# Process
1. Read game parameters
2. Write Python simulation script
3. Run 1000+ simulations
4. Analyze results statistically
5. Report balance verdict

[...]
```

---

## Summary

Sub-agents provide **specialized deep analysis** with **focused context**:

- Design Architect: Technical specifications
- Security Reviewer: Vulnerability audits
- Performance Reviewer: Optimization analysis
- Validator: Final quality gate

**Result:** Comprehensive reviews without diluting main coordinator's context.

**Thorough analysis. Production-ready designs. AAA quality assured.**
