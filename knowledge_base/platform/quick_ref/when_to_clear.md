# When to /clear - Quick Reference

## Proactive Triggers (Use /clear)

✅ **Starting new feature** - Different domain from previous work
✅ **Context >120k** - Before significant task
✅ **Switching work context** - Frontend ↔ Backend, different systems
✅ **Before complex analysis** - Need clean mental slate

## Don't /clear

❌ **Continuing same feature** - All context relevant
❌ **Low token usage** - <80k tokens
❌ **Mid-complex reasoning** - Don't interrupt important discussion

## After /clear

Load in order:
1. CLAUDE.md (auto - invariants + current work)
2. Current feature spec
3. Current files only
4. Recent decisions

**Result:** ~20-30k highly relevant context

**Philosophy:** /clear is proactive curation, not emergency recovery

**See:** @knowledge_base/platform/reference/context_management_full.md
