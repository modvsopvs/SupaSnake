# Game Documentation - Reference MAP

**Purpose**: Links to comprehensive game documentation (full specs, deep-dive guides)

**When to use**: 5% of queries requiring complete context, comprehensive analysis, or implementation reference

**Philosophy**: Most queries should use quick_ref (80%) or how_to (15%). Only escalate to reference docs for deep-dive needs.

## When to Use Reference Docs vs Quick Ref

### Use Quick Ref When:
- âœ… You need a quick answer ("What dynasties exist?")
- âœ… You want summary information (200-300 words)
- âœ… You're checking facts (colors, costs, timelines)
- âœ… You need overview, not details

### Use How-To When:
- âœ… You're implementing a feature (step-by-step guide)
- âœ… You need process documentation (900-1,200 words)
- âœ… You want examples and workflows
- âœ… You need practical application, not theory

### Use Reference Docs When:
- âœ… You need complete specification (all details)
- âœ… You're making architectural decisions
- âœ… You need to understand all options and trade-offs
- âœ… You're doing comprehensive analysis (5,000-20,000 words)

## Usage Guidelines

**Start with Quick Ref** (80% of queries):
- Fastest answers (150-300 words)
- Facts, summaries, checklists
- Decision already made, just need details

**Escalate to How-To** (15% of queries):
- Need step-by-step implementation
- Want examples and workflows
- Making similar feature, need template

**Use Reference Docs** (5% of queries):
- Need complete specification
- Making architectural decisions
- Comprehensive analysis required
- Understanding all options and trade-offs

**Golden Rule**: If quick_ref answers your question, don't load full spec (save 14,800 words / ~20k tokens)
