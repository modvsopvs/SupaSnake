# Seasonal Narratives - Quick Reference

**Source:** design/systems/story_narrative_v2.md

## Core Concept
12-week seasonal story arcs spotlight one dynasty per season, delivering transmedia narrative through in-game events, comics, animated shorts, and environmental storytelling to deepen emotional investment.

## Key Points
- **Seasonal Structure (12 weeks):**
  - Weeks 1-3: Dynasty origin story (comic series, 3 episodes)
  - Weeks 4-6: Rising conflict (in-game quests reveal lore)
  - Weeks 7-9: Climax event (special tournament with narrative stakes)
  - Weeks 10-12: Resolution and setup for next season (animated short finale)
- **Transmedia Pillars:**
  1. **In-Game:** Environmental storytelling (arena details), quest dialogue, cosmetic lore
  2. **Comics:** Weekly 5-page digital comics (free on website/social media)
  3. **Animated Shorts:** 2-3 minute finale videos (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram)
  4. **Social Media:** Character Twitter accounts, behind-the-scenes dev blogs
- **Example Season 1: "Venom Dynasty Origins"**
  - Story: Ancient Venom Dynasty awakens from jungle ruins, seeks to reclaim territory
  - Comics: 12-part series exploring dynasty history, key characters
  - Finale: Venom Queen boss fight event (PvE special mode)
  - Reward: Exclusive "Ancient Venom" legendary variant

## AAA Standards
- **Quality Bar:** Disney/Pixar-level animation for shorts (outsource to proven studios)
- **Narrative Cohesion:** All seasons connect to overarching world mythology
- **Player Agency:** Seasonal outcomes influenced by community choices (voting events)
- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Dynasties inspired by global mythology (respectful representation)

## Implementation Priority
- **MVP:** No narrative (pure competitive gameplay)
- **v1.0:** Basic seasonal themes, in-game quest text only
- **v2.0+:** Full transmedia (comics, animated shorts, social campaigns)
