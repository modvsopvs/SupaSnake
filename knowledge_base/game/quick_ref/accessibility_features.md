## Core Concept
AAA accessibility standards ensuring SupaSnake is playable by widest audience: colorblind modes, reduced motion options, touch-friendly UI, and COPPA/GDPR compliance for inclusive global community.

## Key Points
- **Visual Accessibility:**
  - **Colorblind Modes:** Protanopia, deuteranopia, tritanopia filters (8% of male population)
  - **High Contrast Mode:** Increase UI element borders, background dimming
  - **Dynasty Icons:** Non-color identifiers (shapes, patterns) for instant recognition
  - **Text Scaling:** 100%, 125%, 150% options for low-vision players
- **Motor Accessibility:**
  - **Touch-Friendly UI:** Minimum 44Ã—44pt tap targets (Apple HIG standard)
  - **Swipe Controls:** Alternative to joystick (one-handed play option)
  - **Auto-Aim Assist:** Subtle targeting help for mobility-impaired players (optional)
- **Cognitive Accessibility:**
  - **Reduced Motion:** Disable screen shake, particle effects, camera sway
  - **Simplified UI:** "Streamer mode" hides complex stats, focuses core gameplay
  - **Tutorials:** Text + visual + audio explanations (multi-modal learning)
- **Audio Accessibility:**
  - **Subtitles:** All dialogue, sound effects captioned
  - **Visual Sound Indicators:** Directional arrows for off-screen audio cues
  - **Separate Volume Sliders:** Music, SFX, voice independently adjustable
- **Parental Controls (COPPA Compliance):**
  - Age gate: Require birthdate, restrict under-13 chat/social features
  - Spending limits: Parental approval for purchases (iOS/Android native)
  - Time limits: Session warnings, daily play caps (optional parental setting)

## AAA Standards
- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA:** Web Content Accessibility Guidelines compliance
- **Platform Guidelines:** Apple Accessibility HIG, Google Material Design
- **Legal Compliance:** COPPA (USA), GDPR (EU), PEGI ratings
- **Inclusive Testing:** Partner with accessibility consultants, disabled gamer focus groups

## Implementation Priority
