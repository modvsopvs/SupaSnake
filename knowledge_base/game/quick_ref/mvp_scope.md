# MVP Scope - Quick Reference

**Source:** vision/vision_statement_aaa.md, design/core_loop_aaa.md (implied from AAA docs)

## Core Concept
6-month MVP development delivering core competitive Snake gameplay, basic breeding system (3 dynasties), and guild foundations to validate product-market fit before full AAA production investment.

## Key Points
- **MVP Core Features (Month 0-6):**
  - **Gameplay:** Last Snake Standing mode only (simplest win condition)
  - **Breeding:** 3 dynasties (Venom, Inferno, Frost), 10 variants each (30 total)
  - **Collection:** Basic variant tracking, no rarity visual progression
  - **Competitive:** Bronze-Gold ranked ladder (MMR 0-1500), manual matchmaking
  - **Social:** 20-member guilds, basic chat, no guild wars
  - **Monetization:** Direct DNA purchase ($0.99-$9.99 packs), no battle pass
  - **Platform:** iOS only, English language, NA region (closed beta 1,000 players)
- **Validation Metrics:**
  - D1 retention: 30%+ (baseline, target 40% for v1.0)
  - D7 retention: 15%+ (baseline, target 20% for v1.0)
  - Average session: 15+ minutes (validate 3-minute match cadence)
  - Payer conversion: 3%+ (baseline, target 5% for v1.0)
- **MVP Cuts (Defer to v1.0):**
  - ❌ All 4 win conditions (only Last Snake Standing)
  - ❌ Pity system (basic egg gacha)
  - ❌ Guild wars (guilds exist but no competitive events)
  - ❌ Spectator mode (no esports infrastructure)
  - ❌ Battle pass (manual content updates)
  - ❌ 10 dynasties (only 3 launch dynasties)
  - ❌ Generational breeding (basic egg opening only)

## AAA Standards
- **60fps Gameplay:** Non-negotiable even in MVP (competitive advantage)
- **Fair Matchmaking:** MMR-based even if limited tiers (no random lobbies)
- **Production Quality:** Supercell art bar maintained (fewer variants, same quality)
- **No Pay-to-Win:** Enforced from day one (only cosmetic variants)

## Implementation Priority
- **MVP (6 months):** Validate core loop, breeding hook, guild retention
- **v1.0 (12 months):** Full 10 dynasties, guild wars, battle pass, spectator mode
- **v2.0+ (18+ months):** Esports, transmedia, seasonal narratives
