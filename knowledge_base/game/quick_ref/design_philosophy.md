# Design Philosophy - Quick Reference

**Source:** vision/aaa_design_principles.md

## Core Concept
SupaSnake follows Jesse Schell's top 10 AAA design principles: player-centric experience, holistic design thinking, emotional resonance, and iterative polish to Supercell production standards.

## Key Points
- **Top 5 Principles:**
  1. **Make the Player Feel Powerful:** Skill mastery, outplay moments, ranked progression
  2. **Create Flow State:** 3-minute matches, escalating difficulty, clear goals
  3. **Respect Player Time:** No forced grinding, generous F2P rewards, skip tickets
  4. **Build for Spectating:** Readable clarity for esports, replay system, slow-mo highlights
  5. **Emotional Investment:** Dynasty attachment through breeding history, guild identity
- **Holistic Design:** Every system supports the core loop (breeding → collection → competition)
- **Iterative Polish:** Closed beta testing, data-driven tuning, Supercell-level production values
- **Fair Monetization Philosophy:** "Sell passion, not power" - cosmetics and accelerators only

## AAA Standards
- **Production Quality:** Supercell art/audio standards, 60fps gameplay, sub-100ms input latency
- **Player Psychology:** Hook/Habit/Hobby framework, respect for player agency
- **Ethical Design:** Transparent systems, no dark patterns, COPPA/GDPR compliance
- **Accessibility:** Colorblind modes, reduced motion options, touch-friendly UI

## Implementation Priority
- **MVP:** Core flow state gameplay, basic emotional hooks
- **v1.0:** Full spectator mode, replay system, production polish
- **v2.0+:** Advanced accessibility features, transmedia emotional depth
