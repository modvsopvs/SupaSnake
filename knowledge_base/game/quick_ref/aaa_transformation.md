**Source:** All comprehensive docs (vision/, design/, design/systems/)

## Core Concept
SupaSnake v2.0 (AAA) transforms the solo-dev v1.0 prototype from casual mobile game into competitive esports-ready collection game through Supercell production values, fair monetization, and guild-driven social retention.

## Key Changes (v1.0 Solo-Dev â†’ v2.0 AAA)

**Gameplay Evolution:**
- **v1.0:** Single-player Snake with basic breeding (3 dynasties, 30 variants)
- **v2.0:** Competitive multiplayer with 4 win conditions (10 dynasties, 500+ variants)
- **AAA Upgrade:** Skill-based matchmaking, spectator mode, esports infrastructure

**Breeding System:**
- **v1.0:** Random egg gacha, no pity system, 70% common/30% rare split
- **v2.0:** Fair gacha with guaranteed pity (every 10/50/200 eggs), generational breeding
- **AAA Upgrade:** Transparent drop rates, emotional attachment (breeding history), Ascension prestige

**Social Systems:**
- **v1.0:** Basic friend list, no guilds
- **v2.0:** 50-member guilds, weekly 96-hour Guild Wars, trading post, guild hall customization
- **AAA Upgrade:** 3-4x retention multiplier, appointment gameplay, exclusive rewards

**Monetization:**
- **v1.0:** Direct variant purchases ($0.99-$4.99), pay-to-win concerns
- **v2.0:** Fair gacha eggs + battle pass + cosmetics (no pay-to-win power)
- **AAA Upgrade:** $50M ARR target, 5% conversion, ethical Supercell-level monetization

**Production Quality:**
- **v1.0:** 2D sprites, basic animations, stock music
- **v2.0:** Stylized 3D models, dynasty-specific soundscapes, 60fps locked performance
- **AAA Upgrade:** Supercell art bar, professional audio, esports broadcast quality

**Live Ops:**
- **v1.0:** Manual monthly updates
- **v2.0:** Weekly automated content (52 variants/year), 12-week seasonal narratives

## Investment Delta
- **v1.0 Budget:** $50k (solo dev, 6 months)
- **v2.0 Budget:** $5M+ (AAA team, 18 months to launch)
- **Return:** 100x investment multiplier (v1.0 = $500k ARR potential, v2.0 = $50M ARR target)
