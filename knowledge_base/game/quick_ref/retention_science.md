# Retention Science - Quick Reference

**Source:** design/social_systems_aaa.md, design/live_ops_framework_aaa.md, vision/supercell_monetization_study.md

## Core Concept
Multi-layered retention strategy targeting 40% D1 / 20% D7 / 10% D30 through Hook (first session magic), Habit (daily loops), Hobby (guild investment), leveraging guild membership as 3-4x retention multiplier.

## Key Points
- **D1 Retention (40% target):**
  - Hook: Instant gameplay clarity, first egg opening, matchmaking win
  - Onboarding: 5-minute tutorial, immediate competitive match, guaranteed rare pull
  - Social prompt: Guild recruitment in first 10 minutes
- **D7 Retention (20% target):**
  - Habit: Daily login rewards (DNA, eggs, cosmetics)
  - Guild Wars: Friday-Tuesday weekly event creates appointment gameplay
  - Battle Pass: Weekly challenges with visible progression
- **D30 Retention (10% target):**
  - Hobby: Guild identity and social bonds (guild chat, shared goals)
  - Collection depth: 500+ variants to discover, long-term breeding goals
  - Seasonal resets: New ranked season, fresh leaderboard climb
- **Guild Retention Multiplier:**
  - Solo players: 15% D7, 5% D30
  - Guild members: 45% D7, 20% D30 (3-4x improvement)

## AAA Standards
- **Data-Driven Tuning:** A/B test onboarding flow, optimize for D1 hooks
- **Predictable Cadence:** Players know when content drops (Monday updates, Friday wars)
- **Respect for Time:** No forced daily grinding, generous skip tickets
- **Social Investment:** Guilds create sunk cost (friends, history, identity)

## Implementation Priority
- **MVP:** Basic D1 onboarding, simple daily rewards
- **v1.0:** Full Hook/Habit/Hobby framework, guild war cadence
- **v2.0+:** Advanced retention features (mentorship, clan dynasties, legacy systems)
