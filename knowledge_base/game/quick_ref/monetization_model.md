# Monetization Model - Quick Reference

**Source:** design/monetization_architecture_aaa.md, vision/supercell_monetization_study.md

## Core Concept
Fair gacha breeding system with cosmetic variants, battle pass, and guild perks - no pay-to-win power progression. Target: $50M ARR Year 1 at 10M MAU (5% payer conversion, $100 ARPPU).

## Key Points
- **Revenue Streams:**
  1. **Breeding Eggs (40% revenue):** $2.99-$19.99 dynasty packs, pity system guarantees rarity
  2. **Battle Pass (30% revenue):** $9.99/season (12 weeks), free + premium tracks
  3. **Cosmetic Bundles (20% revenue):** $4.99-$24.99 limited variant bundles
  4. **Guild Perks (10% revenue):** Guild boosts, cosmetic banners, emote packs
- **Fair Gacha Rules:**
  - Pity system: Guaranteed rare every 10 eggs, epic every 50, legendary every 200
  - No duplicate protection (but breeding uses all pulls)
  - Transparent drop rates (required by law in many regions)
- **No Pay-to-Win:** All power from skill and time investment, not spending

## AAA Standards
- Supercell-level fair monetization (transparent, player-friendly)
- Battle pass provides 2-3x value vs direct purchase
- Weekly limited offers create FOMO without predatory tactics
- Guild spending drives social retention (guilds compete for leaderboard)

## Implementation Priority
- **MVP:** Basic egg purchases, no pity system
- **v1.0:** Full pity system, battle pass, guild perks
- **v2.0+:** Seasonal cosmetics, esports team skins, transmedia tie-ins
