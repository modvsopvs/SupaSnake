# Competitive Landscape - Quick Reference

**Source:** vision/snap_competitive_analysis.md

## Core Concept
SupaSnake combines SNAP's skill-first competitive gameplay with Supercell's fair monetization and social retention systems, avoiding pay-to-win while monetizing passion for collection and guild identity.

## Key Points
- **SNAP Model (Skill-First):**
  - No card power creep, pure skill expression
  - Monetize cosmetics (500+ variants, $5-$25 bundles)
  - Problem: Weak social systems, low retention multiplier
- **Supercell Model (Social Retention):**
  - Guilds drive 3-4x retention vs solo players
  - Weekly guild wars create appointment gameplay
  - Problem: Often pay-to-win power progression
- **SupaSnake Hybrid:**
  - SNAP's skill-first gameplay + no pay-to-win
  - Supercell's guild wars and social retention
  - Monetize collection depth + cosmetics, not power

## AAA Standards
- Fair gacha with pity system (guaranteed rarity every 10 eggs)
- Guild wars with meaningful stakes (prestige, exclusive cosmetics)
- Weekly content cadence (new variants, limited events)
- Esports infrastructure (spectator mode, tournaments, World Championship)

## Implementation Priority
- **MVP:** Core competitive gameplay (SNAP inspiration)
- **v1.0:** Guild wars and social systems (Supercell inspiration)
- **v2.0+:** Esports scene, transmedia expansion
