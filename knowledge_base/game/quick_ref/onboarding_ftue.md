# Onboarding & FTUE - Quick Reference

**Source:** design/progression_systems_aaa.md, vision/aaa_design_principles.md

## Core Concept
5-minute tutorial delivering instant gameplay clarity, guaranteed rare snake pull, and immediate competitive match to hook 40% D1 retention through "magic moment" discovery.

## Key Points
- **FTUE Structure (First Time User Experience):**
  - **Minute 0-2:** Instant gameplay (no text walls)
    - NPC opponent tutorial: "Eat 10 food pellets to grow"
    - Guided cut-off maneuver: "Trap the NPC snake"
    - First win: "You just mastered Snake!"
  - **Minute 2-3:** First egg opening (guaranteed rare)
    - Egg animation: Suspenseful hatch sequence
    - Reveal: Rare Venom Dynasty variant (always same for consistency)
    - Emotional hook: "This is YOUR first snake - name it!"
  - **Minute 3-5:** Real competitive match
    - Matchmaking: Pair with other new players (MMR 0-100)
    - Stakes: Wager 50 DNA (free starting DNA)
    - Outcome: Win or lose, earn 100 DNA + unlock guild recruitment
- **Post-Tutorial Hook:**
  - Guild invitation prompt: "Join a guild for 3x more rewards"
  - Second egg: Spend 100 DNA on another common egg (teach breeding loop)
  - First daily quest: "Win 3 matches today for 100 bonus DNA"

## AAA Standards
- **Instant Clarity:** No confusion about goals, mechanics telegraphed visually
- **Guaranteed Dopamine Hit:** Rare pull + competitive win in first 5 minutes
- **Respect for Intelligence:** No hand-holding, let players discover depth
- **Data-Driven Tuning:** A/B test FTUE flow, optimize for D1 retention

## Implementation Priority
- **MVP:** Basic tutorial (text-heavy, no guaranteed rare)
- **v1.0:** Full 5-minute FTUE, guaranteed rare pull, guild recruitment hook
- **v2.0+:** Personalized FTUE (adapt to player skill level), skip option for veterans
