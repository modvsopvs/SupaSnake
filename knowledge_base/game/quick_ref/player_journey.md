# Player Journey - Quick Reference

A distilled overview of the player experience from first launch to retention. For complete journey mapping and metrics, see @docs/game/PLAYER_JOURNEY.md.

## What is the Player Journey?

The player journey maps emotional state, goals, and conversion triggers from discovery through long-term retention. It orchestrates the transition from "just another snake game" to "my snake dynasty empire."

**Core Insight:** Players don't pay for snakes. They pay to nurture their growing genetic empire when life's responsibilities would otherwise interrupt their carefully planned breeding schedule.

## New Player Flow (Session 1: 10-15 minutes)

**Discovery → First Contact (0-30s)**
- Player State: "Another snake game? Let's see..."
- Hook: Dynasty selection screen - "This feels different"
- Goal: "I want to see my snake"

**Tutorial → First Win (30-60s)**
- Experience: Buttery smooth gameplay, satisfying feedback
- Surprise: Post-game DNA reward animation
- New Goal: "What's this DNA thing?"

**Lab Discovery (2-5 min)**
- Mindset Shift: "This isn't just snake"
- Experience: Snake Lab reveal - breeding, collection, evolution
- Investment Start: "I need to build something here"

**Session End (10-15 min)**
- Experience: Energy depleted - scarcity creates value
- Hook Set: "I'll check back when energy refills"
- Pattern Forming: Check energy → Play → Lab → Set timer
