# Progression Paths - Quick Reference

**Source:** design/progression_systems_aaa.md

## Core Concept
Three interconnected progression ladders (Collection, Competitive, Prestige) allow players to advance through skill, breeding depth, or long-term dedication - all roads lead to meaningful endgame.

## Key Points
- **Collection Ladder (Breadth):**
  - Track: Variants discovered (500+ total variants across 10 dynasties)
  - Rewards: Unlock new dynasties, exclusive cosmetics, breeding bonuses
  - Milestones: 50 variants (Bronze), 150 (Silver), 300 (Gold), 500 (Diamond)
- **Competitive Ladder (Skill):**
  - Track: Ranked MMR (Bronze → Diamond → Master → Grandmaster)
  - Rewards: Seasonal cosmetics, tournament entries, prestige titles
  - Season: 12 weeks, MMR soft reset each season
- **Prestige Ladder (Time Investment):**
  - Track: Account level, generational breeding (Gen 5+ Ascension)
  - Rewards: Profile borders, emotes, guild perks, rare breeding recipes
  -永久 (Permanent): Never resets, long-term mastery recognition

## AAA Standards
- **No Dead Ends:** Every path has endgame goals (not just competitive)
- **Parallel Progression:** Collectors and competitors both rewarded
- **F2P Viable:** All three ladders climbable without spending (time investment)
- **Seasonal Refreshes:** New collection targets and competitive seasons every 12 weeks

## Implementation Priority
- **MVP:** Basic collection tracking, simple ranked ladder
- **v1.0:** Full 3-ladder system, seasonal resets, prestige rewards
- **v2.0+:** Grand Master tier, lifetime achievement systems, Hall of Fame
