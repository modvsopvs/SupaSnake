# F2P Economy - Quick Reference

**Source:** design/monetization_architecture_aaa.md, design/progression_systems_aaa.md

## Core Concept
Generous F2P DNA economy (300-500 DNA daily) enabling egg purchases, breeding, and collection progression without spending, maintaining 5% payer conversion while respecting non-payers.

## Key Points
- **Daily F2P DNA Income:**
  - Match wins: 50 DNA per win (6 wins daily = 300 DNA)
  - Daily quests: 100 DNA total (3 quests @ 33 DNA each)
  - Guild contributions: 50 DNA (participate in guild war activities)
  - Weekly login streak: 200 DNA bonus (day 7)
  - **Total: 300-500 DNA daily** (or 2,100-3,500 DNA weekly)
- **DNA Costs:**
  - Common Dynasty Egg: 100 DNA (3 per week F2P)
  - Premium Dynasty Egg: 500 DNA (1 per week F2P)
  - Breeding (Gen 1×1): 50 DNA
  - Breeding (Gen 2×2): 100 DNA
  - Breeding (Gen 5×5): 200 DNA
- **F2P Collection Pace:**
  - Week 1: 3-5 common eggs, 10-15 new variants discovered
  - Month 1: 15-20 eggs total, 40-60 variants (12% of 500 total)
  - Year 1: 150+ eggs, 300+ variants (60% collection complete)
- **Payer vs F2P Comparison:**
  - F2P: 60% collection in Year 1 (time investment)
  - Whale: 95% collection in Year 1 (spending $2,000+)
  - Moderate spender: 80% collection in Year 1 (Battle Pass + occasional packs)

## AAA Standards
- **No Paywalls:** All content accessible to F2P (no "premium-only" variants)
- **Generous Daily Income:** F2P players feel progress every session
- **Time Respecting:** No forced grinding, skip tickets for repetitive content
- **Fair Competitive Balance:** Payers have more cosmetic options, not power advantage

## Implementation Priority
- **MVP:** Basic match rewards, simple quests
- **v1.0:** Full daily quest system, guild reward bonuses
- **v2.0+:** Advanced progression (achievements, seasonal pass free track)
