# Guild Wars - Quick Reference

**Source:** design/systems/guild_systems_v2.md

## Core Concept
Weekly 96-hour competitive events (Friday 5pm → Tuesday 5pm) where 20 matched guilds battle for trophy leaderboard dominance, exclusive cosmetics, and prestige - the primary social retention driver.

## Key Points
- **War Structure:**
  - Duration: 96 hours (Friday 5pm PT → Tuesday 5pm PT)
  - Matchmaking: 20 guilds matched by trophy count (±100 trophy range)
  - Participation: Minimum 10 active members required
  - Scoring: Members earn war points through matches, breeding, quests
- **Scoring System:**
  - Match wins: 10 war points (multiplied by match difficulty tier)
  - Breeding contributions: 5 war points per egg opened
  - Daily quests: 15 war points per completed quest
  - Guild total: Sum of all members' contributions
- **Rewards (Top 3 Guilds):**
  - 1st place: Exclusive legendary cosmetic, 5000 DNA per member, +50 guild trophies
  - 2nd place: Exclusive epic cosmetic, 3000 DNA per member, +30 guild trophies
  - 3rd place: Exclusive rare cosmetic, 1500 DNA per member, +15 guild trophies
- **Guild Leaderboard:** Global ranking by total trophies, seasonal reset

## AAA Standards
- **Appointment Gameplay:** Predictable weekly schedule creates habit loop
- **Fair Matchmaking:** Trophy-based brackets prevent mismatch stomps
- **Social Pressure (Positive):** Members contribute to guild success, no individual blame
- **Exclusive Rewards:** War cosmetics only available through guild participation

## Implementation Priority
- **MVP:** Basic guild vs guild scoring prototype
- **v1.0:** Full 20-guild matchmaking, exclusive rewards, leaderboard
- **v2.0+:** Guild Raids (PvE boss fights), Guild Championships (top guilds compete)
