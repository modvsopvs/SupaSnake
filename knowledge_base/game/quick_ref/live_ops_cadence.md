# Live Ops Cadence - Quick Reference

**Source:** design/live_ops_framework_aaa.md

## Core Concept
Weekly content pipeline delivering new variants, limited events, and seasonal storylines to create appointment gameplay, prevent content droughts, and drive 40% D1 / 20% D7 retention.

## Key Points
- **Weekly Content (52 weeks/year):**
  - New variant drops: 1-2 new cosmetic variants every Monday
  - Limited-time events: Weekend tournaments (Friday-Sunday)
  - Flash offers: 24-48 hour cosmetic bundles (FOMO monetization)
- **Seasonal Structure (12-week cycles, 4 seasons/year):**
  - Season theme: Dynasty spotlight with narrative arc
  - Battle Pass: 100 tiers (free + premium $9.99)
  - Seasonal map: New arena with thematic hazards
  - Finale event: 2-week championship tournament
- **Major Updates (Quarterly):**
  - New dynasty unlock (every 3 months post-launch)
  - System expansion: New competitive mode or social feature
  - Balance patches: Meta shifts, dynasty adjustments

## AAA Standards
- **Predictable Cadence:** Players know when new content drops (every Monday 10am PT)
- **No Content Droughts:** Minimum 1 new piece of content weekly
- **Seasonal Hype Cycles:** 12-week arcs build anticipation for finale
- **Data-Driven Tuning:** A/B test event formats, iterate based on engagement

## Implementation Priority
- **MVP:** Monthly manual updates, no automated pipeline
- **v1.0:** Weekly automated content drops, 12-week seasonal structure
- **v2.0+:** Daily login events, community challenges, transmedia tie-ins
