# Evolution & Prestige - Quick Reference

**Source:** design/systems/evolution_prestige_v2.md

## Core Concept
Generational breeding system where players combine snakes to create higher-generation offspring (Gen 1 → Gen 5+), unlocking Ascension prestige tiers with cosmetic glows and exclusive titles for long-term dedication.

## Key Points
- **Generational Breeding:**
  - Gen 1: Base snakes from eggs (no parents)
  - Gen 2-4: Breed two parents → offspring inherits generation +1
  - Gen 5+: "Ascended" snakes with cosmetic prestige glow
  - Breeding cost scales: 50 DNA (Gen 1×1), 100 DNA (Gen 2×2), 200 DNA (Gen 5×5)
- **Ascension Tiers (Gen 5+):**
  - **Ascended (Gen 5-9):** Silver glow aura, "Ascended" title
  - **Exalted (Gen 10-14):** Gold glow aura, "Exalted" title
  - **Transcendent (Gen 15+):** Prismatic rainbow glow, "Transcendent" title
- **Prestige Rewards:**
  - Exclusive profile borders, emotes, guild hall decorations
  - Breeding recipe bonuses (higher rarity offspring chance)
  - Permanent account progression (never resets)

## AAA Standards
- **No Pay-to-Win:** Ascension is purely cosmetic prestige, no competitive advantage
- **Long-Term Goals:** Transcendent tier requires months of dedication (whale or F2P)
- **Visual Flex:** Prestige glows visible in matches, replays, guild halls
- **Generational History:** Track breeding lineage, see "family tree" of favorite snake

## Implementation Priority
- **MVP:** Basic Gen 1-3 breeding, no prestige system
- **v1.0:** Full Gen 1-5 system, Ascended tier with glow effects
- **v2.0+:** Exalted/Transcendent tiers, breeding lineage viewer, Hall of Legends
