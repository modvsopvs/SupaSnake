# Esports Infrastructure - Quick Reference

**Source:** design/systems/competitive_systems_v2.md, vision/vision_statement_aaa.md

## Core Concept
Build-ready esports ecosystem from day one: spectator mode, tournament tools, professional league infrastructure culminating in annual $500k World Championship, targeting Clash Royale-level competitive scene.

## Key Points
- **Spectator Mode (v1.0 launch):**
  - Watch any Grandmaster match live (Top 500 players)
  - Observer UI: Player stats, minimap, replay controls (pause, slow-mo, rewind)
  - Caster tools: Draw on screen, highlight key moments, player POV switching
- **Tournament Infrastructure:**
  - **Weekly Community Tournaments:** Open entry, automated brackets, DNA prizes
  - **Monthly Pro Tournaments:** Grandmaster only, $10k prize pool, online qualifier
  - **Quarterly Regional Championships:** NA/EU/ASIA, 64 players each, $50k prize pool
  - **Annual World Championship:** 128 players globally, $500k prize pool, live event
- **Competitive Ecosystem:**
  - Official ladder API for third-party stat tracking
  - Replay sharing system (download/upload match files)
  - Team/organization support (guild-based esports teams)
  - Streamer integration (Twitch drops, YouTube sponsorships)

## AAA Standards
- **Visual Clarity:** Instantly readable for spectators (distinct dynasty silhouettes)
- **Production Quality:** Broadcast-ready overlay graphics, automated highlight generation
- **Anti-Cheat:** Server-authoritative, input validation, pattern detection (permaban penalties)
- **Prize Pool Sustainability:** Crowdfunding (Battle Pass 25% funds prize pool, like Dota 2)

## Implementation Priority
- **MVP:** No spectator mode, manual tournaments only
- **v1.0:** Full spectator mode, automated brackets, monthly pro tournaments
- **v2.0+:** Regional leagues, World Championship, official esports partnerships
