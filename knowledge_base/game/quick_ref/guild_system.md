# Guild System - Quick Reference

**Source:** design/social_systems_aaa.md, design/systems/guild_systems_v2.md

## Core Concept
Guilds are the social retention multiplier - 50-member communities competing in weekly 96-hour Guild Wars for prestige, exclusive cosmetics, and leaderboard dominance, driving 3-4x retention vs solo players.

## Key Points
- **Guild Structure:**
  - 50 members max, 5 ranks (Leader, Officers, Veterans, Members, Recruits)
  - Guild Hall: Customizable HQ, trophy display, member leaderboards
  - Requirements: 10 members minimum to participate in Guild Wars
- **Weekly Guild Wars (96-hour events):**
  - 20 guilds matched by trophy count (similar to Clash of Clans)
  - Scoring: Members earn war points through matches, breeding contributions, quests
  - Rewards: Top 3 guilds earn exclusive cosmetics, DNA bonuses, prestige trophies
- **Guild Trading Post:**
  - Trade duplicate variants (rares/epics only, legendaries excluded)
  - Trade cooldown: 7 days per variant to prevent market manipulation
- **Social Features:** Guild chat, replay sharing, breeding advice, emote packs

## AAA Standards
- **Appointment Gameplay:** Wars start Friday 5pm, end Tuesday 5pm (weekend peak)
- **Fair Matchmaking:** Trophy-based brackets prevent mismatches
- **Anti-Toxicity:** Leader/officer moderation tools, report system, AI chat filtering
- **Guild Identity:** Custom banners, colors, mottos, prestige history

## Implementation Priority
- **MVP:** Basic 20-member guilds, simple chat
- **v1.0:** Full 50-member guilds, Guild Wars, trading post, Hall customization
- **v2.0+:** Guild Raids (PvE boss fights), Guild Championships (esports league)
