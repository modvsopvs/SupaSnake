# Chapter 35: Your Purpose - Summary

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (3rd Edition, 2020), Chapter 35

**Core Thesis:** Every designer needs a clear purpose - a deep "why" that sustains them through difficult development, guides tough decisions, and defines their legacy. Without purpose, external pressures lead to burnout, ethical compromise, and unfulfilling careers.

## Key Concepts

### Purpose vs. Goals

**Goals** are specific, measurable, temporary:
- "Launch game by Q4"
- "Reach 100,000 downloads"
- "Generate $50,000 revenue"
- "Win Best Mobile Game award"

**Purpose** is enduring, directional, intrinsic:
- "Bring joy to people's lives"
- "Prove ethical game design works"
- "Build sustainable indie career"
- "Help players discover their potential"

**Goals measure progress. Purpose guides direction.**

**Key Distinction:**
- Goals: What you want to ACHIEVE
- Purpose: Why you want to achieve it
- Goals change frequently. Purpose evolves slowly.
- Goals can be completed. Purpose endures.

### Finding Your Purpose

**Schell's Core Question:** "Why do you make games?"

**Not acceptable answers:**
- "To make money" (money is requirement, not purpose)
- "Because I like games" (too surface-level)
- "Because I'm good at it" (skill ≠ purpose)

**Real purpose answers:**
- "To create experiences that transform people"
- "To build communities around shared joy"
- "To challenge industry norms"
- "To explore meaningful themes"
- "To help players see themselves differently"

**Your purpose must resonate emotionally and guide decisions.**

### The Purpose Lens (#119)

**To use this lens, ask:**
- Why am I making this game?
- What impact do I want to have on those who play it?
- What impact do I want to have on the world at large?
- How does this game align with my purpose as a designer?
- What would make me abandon this project?
- What would make me proudest about this project?

**Purpose reveals itself in honest answers to these questions.**

## Purpose-Driven Design

### Decision-Making Framework

**When facing design dilemma:**

**Example 1: Daily Login Bonuses**
- **Consideration:** "Should I add daily login rewards? (Common F2P pattern)"
- **Purpose Check:** Does this serve my purpose?
  - Ethical F2P? → No (creates FOMO, manipulates players)
  - Player transformation? → No (teaches compulsion, not strategy)
  - Career sustainability? → No (reputation as manipulative designer)
  - Future mentorship? → No (can't teach this as ethical practice)
- **Decision:** Reject daily login bonuses
- **Alternative:** Energy regeneration (pacing without FOMO)

**Example 2: Loot Boxes for Revenue**
- **Consideration:** "Revenue low, should I add mystery egg loot boxes?"
- **Purpose Check:**
  - Ethical F2P? → No (core purpose contradiction)
  - Player respect? → No (gambling psychology)
  - Sustainability? → No (burns reputation)
  - Mentorship? → No (can't recommend to others)
- **Decision:** Reject loot boxes
- **Alternative:** Improve marketing of existing ethical systems

**Example 3: Spending Cap Removal**
- **Consideration:** "Whales want to spend more, remove energy cap?"
- **Purpose Check:**
  - Player protection? → No (cap protects vulnerable)
  - Ethical stance? → No (core to ethical F2P proof)
  - Career reputation? → No (abandons differentiation)
  - Future teaching? → No (can't mentor "remove protections")
- **Decision:** Keep spending cap
- **Alternative:** Add cosmetic options that don't affect gameplay

**Purpose acts as filter: Quick "no" to misaligned options.**

### Purpose-Aligned Features

**Each feature serves purpose, not just adds content.**

## Sustaining Purpose

### Challenges to Purpose

**Schell warns of common threats:**

**1. Revenue Pressure:**
- **Threat:** "Game isn't profitable enough"
- **Temptation:** Compromise ethics for quick revenue
- **Purpose Response:** "My purpose is proving ethical works, not getting rich quick. If it fails ethically, that's valuable data."
- **SupaSnake:** Patient timeline, conservative estimates, backup income plan

**2. Peer Pressure:**
- **Threat:** "Other devs use loot boxes and succeed"
- **Temptation:** "Maybe I should copy proven models..."
- **Purpose Response:** "My purpose is raising standards, not following crowd. I'm proving something different."
- **SupaSnake:** Focus on differentiation, ignore peer choices

**3. Burnout Risk:**
- **Threat:** "Behind schedule, need to crunch"
- **Temptation:** Work unsustainable hours
- **Purpose Response:** "My purpose includes sustainability. Crunch means bad planning."
- **SupaSnake:** Cut scope, extend timeline, protect health

**4. Comparison to Others:**
- **Threat:** "AAA game looks better than mine"
- **Temptation:** "I'm a failure, give up"
- **Purpose Response:** "My purpose is my path. Solo dev ≠ 100-person team."
- **SupaSnake:** Celebrate own progress, different contexts

**Purpose provides resilience against external pressures.**

### Sustainable Practices

**Purpose needs sustainable practices to endure:**

**Physical Sustainability:**
- Sleep 7-9 hours (non-negotiable)
- Exercise 30+ min daily
- Healthy eating, ergonomics
- Eye breaks, standing desk
- **SupaSnake:** 20-30 hrs/week work, exercise midday

**Mental Sustainability:**
- Therapy/counseling (process stress)
- Journaling (reflect, track patterns)
- Meditation (10 min daily)
- Creative recovery (hobbies outside gamedev)
- **SupaSnake:** Weekly journaling, monthly therapy, music hobby

**Emotional Sustainability:**
- Process setbacks (don't internalize failure)
- Celebrate progress (not just final product)
- Community support (indie dev groups)
- Boundaries (can say "no")
- **SupaSnake:** Post-milestone reflection, share publicly, Discord community

**Financial Sustainability:**
- 6-12 months runway saved
- Conservative revenue estimates
- Backup income plan
- Budget for dev costs
- **SupaSnake:** $18k saved, $500/month estimate, contract work backup

**Social Sustainability:**
- Weekly family time
- Monthly friend hangouts
- Non-gamedev activities
- Partner communication
- **SupaSnake:** Friday family dinner, monthly game night, weekly hiking

**Purpose + Sustainable Practices = Decades-long career.**

## Purpose Evolution

### Healthy Evolution

**Purpose can evolve naturally:**

**Year 1:** "Learn mobile F2P development"
**Year 2:** "Ship ethical mobile F2P game"
**Year 3:** "Prove ethical F2P profitable"
**Year 5:** "Help other indie devs succeed ethically"
**Year 10:** "Be known for ethical game design leadership"

**Core value (ethics) constant. Specific purpose grows with experience.**

### Unhealthy Drift

**Warning signs of purpose drift:**
- Justifying dark patterns ("just this once")
- Losing joy in work (chasing money instead)
- Compromising values repeatedly
- Resentment building
- Work consuming life unsustainably

**If drifting, return to purpose discovery process.**

### Annual Purpose Review

**Schell recommends yearly purpose reflection:**

**Review Questions:**
1. Does my stated purpose still resonate emotionally?
2. Are my daily actions aligned with purpose?
3. Has my purpose evolved naturally?
4. Do I need to recommit to original purpose?
5. What adjustments would realign me?

**Write updated purpose statement annually. Track evolution.**

## Legacy and Purpose

### Purpose Defines Legacy

**Schell connects purpose to legacy:**

**Purpose (present-focused):**
- Why you make games now
- What drives daily decisions
- How you want to work

**Legacy (future-focused):**
- How you'll be remembered
- Lasting impact of your work
- Values you embodied

**Purpose → Consistent Actions → Legacy**

**SupaSnake Purpose → Legacy:**
- **Purpose:** Prove ethical F2P works
- **Actions:** Transparent systems, spending caps, no dark patterns
- **Legacy:** "Early pioneer of ethical mobile F2P, proved integrity and profitability coexist"

### The 100-Year Test

**Schell's thought experiment:**

"Imagine someone discovers your game in 100 years. What will they think of you? What values will they see in your design choices?"

**SupaSnake 100-Year View:**
- "Transparent probabilities before it was legally required"
- "Spending caps when industry encouraged whaling"
- "Solo dev who prioritized ethics over maximum extraction"
- "Early example of respectful mobile F2P"

**Design as if future scholars will judge your ethics.**

## Key Quotes

**"Your purpose is not what you do, but why you do it. Anyone can make games. The question is: why do YOU make games? That answer is your purpose, and it will define your career."** - Jesse Schell

**"Money is a requirement for sustainability, but it's not a purpose. If your only purpose is profit, you'll compromise your values the moment revenue pressure appears. Find a deeper why."** - Jesse Schell

**"Purpose is the compass that guides you when peers pressure you to compromise, when revenue falls short, when burnout threatens. Without purpose, you're adrift in the chaos of game development."** - Jesse Schell

**"Your legacy is the sum of your purpose-driven actions. Design with intention, live with integrity, and your work will endure long after you're gone."** - Jesse Schell
