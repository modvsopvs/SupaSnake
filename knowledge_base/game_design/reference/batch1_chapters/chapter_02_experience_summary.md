# Chapter 2: The Designer Creates an Experience - Summary

**Edition:** 1st Edition (2008)
**Relevance to SupaSnake:** Critical (Core framework for Collection Lab and player satisfaction)

## Chapter Overview

Schell establishes that designers don't care about games—they care about **experiences**. Games are artifacts (cards, code, rules) that enable experiences (feelings, thoughts, actions) in players' minds. The game/experience split is more obvious in games than linear media because games grant player agency (pacing, choice, sequence). Designers build artifacts hoping they generate intended experiences but never directly control the outcome—experiences exist only in players' minds and are unsharable. Schell introduces three approaches to understanding experience: **Psychology** (mechanisms of mind), **Anthropology** (holistic study of people), and **Design** (rules of thumb from creators). **Introspection** (examining your own experiences) is a key tool but has two perils: (1) leading to false conclusions about reality (less dangerous for designers than scientists), and (2) assuming your experience matches others' (solved through empathy and observation). Techniques for introspection: analyze memories, two passes, sneak glances, observe silently. The chapter introduces **Lens #1: Essential Experience**—identify what experience you want, what's essential to it, and how your game captures that essence. Example: Wii Sports Baseball focused on swinging the controller (essential) and cut traditional baseball details (incidental).

## Key Concepts Extracted

### Concept 1: Game vs. Experience Distinction
The game (artifact) is a means to an end. The experience (what players feel) is the designer's true goal. "If a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it, does it make a sound?" Applied to games: if no one plays, the experience doesn't exist.

### Concept 2: Essential Experience (Lens #1)
Every memorable experience has key features (essential) and incidental details. Designers must identify the essence and find ways to capture it through art, sound, rules, mechanics. Wii Sports Baseball example: swinging the controller was essential; nine innings and stealing bases were incidental.

**How-To:** @knowledge_base/game_design/how_to/apply_to_supasnake/apply_experience_design_to_collection_lab.md

### Concept 3: Three Approaches to Understanding Experience
- **Psychology**: Mechanisms of mind (behaviorism vs. phenomenology)—useful but avoids subjective experience
- **Anthropology**: Holistic study (cultural anthropology's fieldwork + empathy)—immersive observation of players
- **Design**: Rules of thumb from creators (musicians, architects, filmmakers)—practical but disconnected across disciplines

**Application:** SupaSnake benefits from all three—psychology (Panini collection psychology), anthropology (observing mobile player sessions), design (gacha mechanics from other mobile games).

### Concept 4: Introspection as Designer Tool
Examining your own experiences to make rapid design judgments. **Peril #1** (false reality) doesn't harm designers (we care about "feels true," not "is true"). **Peril #2** (subjectivity) requires empathy—observe others, put yourself in their place, map how your tastes differ from theirs.

### Concept 5: Introspection Techniques
Four methods to observe experiences without tainting them:
1. **Analyze memories**: Reflect after experiencing, not during
2. **Two passes**: Experience untainted, then replay analyzing
3. **Sneak glances**: Quick mental checks mid-experience ("Exciting? Yes.")
4. **Observe silently**: Zen-like dual consciousness—one mind experiencing, one mind watching

**Application:** Play 10 rounds of SupaSnake untainted, then replay analyzing DNA earn rate, energy depletion feel, and Collection Lab appeal.

### Concept 6: Dissecting Your Feelings
Go beyond "I like this" or "this is bad"—articulate **why**. Bad pizza example: "It was bad" vs. "Too cold, soggy crust, not enough cheese." Applied to games: "Energy system feels bad" vs. "5-minute refill feels punitive when I'm engaged but fine when I'm naturally disengaging."

**Application:** When playtesting SupaSnake, force yourself to dissect: "Lab pulls feel unrewarding because the DNA cost (20) requires 1 full game round, and the Common unlock (60% chance) has no visual flair—I expected excitement, got disappointment."

### Concept 7: Games Grant Unique Experiences
Games sacrifice designer control (linear media's luxury) for player agency. This creates feelings only games can deliver: freedom, responsibility, accomplishment, friendship. The trade-off: harder to predict experience outcomes, but worth it for unique emotional territory.

**Application:** SupaSnake's Collection Lab could deliver variants deterministically (choose which to unlock), but RNG creates surprise—a uniquely game-like emotion.

## SupaSnake Applications

**Collection Lab as Essential Experience Design:**

**Target Experience:** "I just pulled a rare Pokémon card—thrilled, heart racing, want to show friends, crave another pull."

**Essential Elements:**
- Anticipation (delayed reveal)
- Surprise (RNG)
- Rarity hierarchy (Common/Uncommon/Rare/Epic)
- Visual distinction (Rare looks better)
- Progression feedback (collection screen)

**How SupaSnake Captures Essence:**
- Anticipation: Egg-hatching animation (2 seconds)
- Surprise: Weighted RNG (60% Common, 8% Rare, 2% Epic)
- Rarity: Dynasty system with stat + visual tiers
- Visual: Rare variants have glow, particle trails, animated textures
- Progression: Collection screen shows silhouettes of locked variants

**Game vs. Experience Split in Mobile F2P:**

**Artifact (what you build):** DNA cost, RNG percentages, sprite assets, UI layout

**Experience (what players feel):** Varies by player:
- Player A: "Quick dopamine, cool snake, I'll be back tomorrow"
- Player B: "Too grindy, uninstall"

**Designer's job:** Tune artifact (lower DNA cost from 20 → 15) to increase % of players having Player A's experience.

**Introspection for Solo Devs:**
- You're your first playtester—introspection is mandatory
- Dissect feelings: "Energy depletion after 3 rounds feels frustrating—why? Because I wanted to try Classic Mode but couldn't."
- Validate with others: Your tolerance for grind likely exceeds your audience's

**Essential vs. Incidental for Energy System:**

**Target Experience:** "Natural break point that makes me want to return tomorrow."

**Essential:**
- Depletion feels fair, not punitive
- Refill timer is clear and reasonable
- Ad option exists for engaged players

**Incidental:**
- Whether cap is 5 or 7 (tune based on feel, not theory)
- Whether refill is 3 or 5 minutes (same)
- Whether it's called "energy" or "stamina" (branding, not essence)

## Lenses Introduced

**Lens #1: The Lens of Essential Experience**

Questions:
1. What experience do I want the player to have?
2. What is essential to that experience?
3. How can my game capture that essence?

**SupaSnake Application Example:**
1. Experience: "I unlocked all variants in a dynasty and feel proud"
2. Essential: Completionism drive, visual feedback, celebratory moment
3. Capture: Collection screen shows dynasty completion percentage, unlocking final variant triggers "Dynasty Master!" badge + exclusive G1 variant

## 2008 vs 2025 Context

**Timeless:**
- Game/experience distinction (unchanged)
- Essential experience lens (universal design tool)
- Introspection techniques (human psychology constant)

**Dated:**
- **2008 context**: Schell discusses "artificial reality" (direct brain experiences) as distant dream.
- **2025 mobile**: VR/AR exist but aren't mainstream. Mobile F2P is dominant, making game/experience split even wider—monetization gates (energy, gacha) mean artifacts *intentionally limit* experiences to drive revenue. Ethical F2P = balancing artifact constraints vs. experience quality.

**Modern Evolution:**
- **Introspection + Analytics**: 2008 assumed introspection + playtesting. 2025 adds quantitative feedback—retention curves, session length, DAU/MAU. Use introspection to generate hypotheses, analytics to validate.
- **Experience Design in F2P**: Essential experience must now include "respects player time" and "feels fair, not exploitative"—new constraints for 2025 mobile designers.
