## Chapter Overview

Schell deconstructs the art of pitching‚Äîhow to convince others (publishers, investors, platforms) that your game is worth funding or featuring. For self-publishing indies, "the pitch" happens in the App Store (ASO), to potential beta testers (community building), and potentially to investors (future funding). The core skill: communicate your game's unique value in 30 seconds to 3 minutes.

## Key Concepts

### 1. The "Elevator Pitch" Structure

**30-second version (for App Store subtitle, social media)**:

**Formula**: [Familiar Hook] + [Unique Twist] + [Player Benefit]

**SupaSnake example**:
- "Remember Snake from your old phone? [FAMILIAR]
- Now breed and collect them. [UNIQUE]
- Discover 45 rare variants." [BENEFIT]

**Schell's principle**: Familiarity reduces cognitive load (player understands base game), uniqueness creates interest (what's new?), benefit closes (why should I care?)

### 2. The 3-Minute Pitch (For Publishers/Investors)

**Schell's pitch structure**:

**Slide 1: The Hook** (30 seconds)
- One sentence: "Classic Snake meets Pok√©mon breeding"
- Visual: Gameplay GIF (instant understanding)

**Slides 2-3: The Problem/Opportunity** (45 seconds)
- Market size: Mobile casual games = $50B
- Gap: No arcade + breeding hybrid
- Audience: Nostalgic millennials + casual collectors

**Slides 4-5: The Solution** (60 seconds)
- Core loop: Play Snake ‚Üí Earn DNA ‚Üí Breed variants ‚Üí Collect 45 snakes
- Meta-game: 3 dynasties, Mendelian genetics, skill + RNG
- Monetization: F2P + energy + cosmetics ($1-5 LTV target)

**Slides 6-7: Traction** (30 seconds)
- Beta: 500 testers, 35% Day 1 retention
- Soft launch: 2,000 downloads, 3% conversion
- Revenue: $500 first month (proves monetization)

**Slide 8-9: The Ask** (30 seconds)
- Seeking: $50k for 6 months full-time
- Use: Artist ($20k), marketing ($20k), living ($10k)
- Offer: 20% equity OR 30% revenue share

**Slide 10: Team** (15 seconds)
- Solo dev: React Native expert, 10 years web dev, shipped X apps
- Advisor: [If you have one]

**Total**: 3 minutes (leaves 7 min for Q&A in 10-min slot)

### 3. Pitching to Different Audiences

**App Store (ASO "pitch")**:
- Audience: Casual players, 10-second attention span
- Goal: Convert impression ‚Üí download
- Format: Icon + name + screenshots + first 3 lines description
- Tone: Clear, benefit-focused (not clever, not jargon)

**Beta testers (community "pitch")**:
- Audience: Early adopters, game enthusiasts
- Goal: Recruit 100-500 testers for feedback + launch spike
- Format: Twitter/Discord/Reddit post (150-300 words)
- Tone: Authentic, "help me build this," behind-the-scenes

**Investors (funding "pitch")**:
- Audience: VCs, angels, publishers (business-focused)
- Goal: Raise $50-500k for full-time development
- Format: Pitch deck (10-15 slides, 10 minutes)
- Tone: Professional, data-driven, realistic projections

**Platform holders (featuring "pitch")**:
- Audience: Apple/Google editorial teams
- Goal: Get featured in "New Games We Love" (10x downloads)
- Format: App Store Connect pitch form (500 words)
- Tone: Highlight innovation, polish, topical relevance

### 4. Common Pitch Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Leading with Features**

**Bad**: "We have 3 dynasties, 45 snakes, Mendelian genetics, energy system..."
- Listener: "So what? Why do I care?"

**Good**: "Ever wondered what happens if you cross two snakes? SupaSnake lets you breed and collect 45 variants."
- Listener: "Oh, that's different. Tell me more."

**Schell's rule**: Benefits first (why play?), features second (how it works)

**Mistake 2: No Traction/Proof**

**Bad**: "This game will be huge! Trust me."
- Listener: "Every developer says that."

**Good**: "500 beta testers, 35% Day 1 retention, 3% already paid."
- Listener: "Okay, you have real data. Believable."

**Schell's rule**: Data > claims (show, don't tell)

**Mistake 3: Unclear Ask**

**Bad**: "We need money to make this great."
- Listener: "How much? For what?"

**Good**: "Seeking $50k for 6 months full-time: $20k artist, $20k marketing, $10k living expenses."
- Listener: "Specific, reasonable, I know exactly what you need."

**Mistake 4: Over-Promising**

**Bad**: "We'll make $1M Year 1! 10M downloads!"
- Listener: "Unrealistic. This dev doesn't understand the market."

**Good**: "Conservative: 10k downloads Year 1, $10k revenue. Stretch: 100k downloads, $100k revenue."
- Listener: "Realistic. This dev knows indie mobile is hard."

**Schell's rule**: Conservative projections = credible, wild claims = amateur

### 5. The "Why This, Why Now, Why You" Framework

**Why THIS game?**
- What's unique? (Breeding + Snake = unexplored hybrid)
- What's the market gap? (No arcade + genetics game)
- Why is it FUN? (Collection + skill progression)

**Why NOW?**
- Market timing: Mobile F2P mature, players seek ethical monetization
- Nostalgia trend: Retro games resurgent (Snake '97 = 10M downloads)
- Tech maturity: React Native + Supabase enable solo dev to ship cross-platform

**Why YOU?**
- Skills match: 10 years web dev, React Native expert
- Passion: "I grew up playing Snake, wanted to evolve it"
- Track record: [Any prior apps, even small ones, show you can ship]

**SupaSnake pitch using framework**:
- **THIS**: Snake + Pok√©mon breeding (unique hybrid, proven mechanics)
- **NOW**: Nostalgia wave (millennials, Snake on Nokia) + ethical F2P demand (post-loot box backlash)
- **YOU**: React Native expert, solo dev efficiency, can ship in 6 months part-time

### 6. Handling Objections

**Common objection 1**: "Snake is overdone."
- **Response**: "Yes, classic Snake is crowded (100+ clones). But NO Snake game has breeding + collection meta. We're not competing with Snake.io (multiplayer), we're Pok√©mon-ifying Snake (new audience)."

**Common objection 2**: "F2P is too competitive."
- **Response**: "Agreed, F2P is hard. That's why we're targeting 10k downloads Year 1 (conservative), not 1M (unrealistic). Soft launch in Canada first, validate before scaling."

**Common objection 3**: "Solo dev, can you really ship?"
- **Response**: "I've shipped [X apps, Y websites, Z projects]. React Native + Expo + Supabase = proven solo dev stack. Prototype already playable (demo now?)."

**Schell's principle**: Acknowledge objection (don't dismiss), provide evidence-based response (not defensive)

### 7. The Demo is King

**Schell's golden rule**: "A playable demo is worth 1,000 pitch decks."

**Why demos matter**:
- Publisher/investor can FEEL the game (not imagine)
- Proves you can ship (not just talk)
- Shows unique mechanics (breeding hard to explain, easy to show)
- Generates excitement (fun demo ‚Üí "I want to play more!")

**SupaSnake demo strategy**:
- 10-minute playable (Classic Snake ‚Üí Breeding ‚Üí First variant unlocked)
- Mobile (TestFlight link, let them play on their phone)
- Polished (no placeholder art, no crashes)
- Focused (core loop only, not 50% complete game with all features)

**Demo > Pitch Deck** (but have deck for follow-up)

## Practical Pitching Advice

### Do:
- ‚úÖ **Start with hook** ("Remember Snake? Now breed them.")
- ‚úÖ **Show traction** (beta data, retention metrics, revenue proof)
- ‚úÖ **Be specific** ($50k for X, Y, Z)
- ‚úÖ **Have demo ready** (playable beats slides)
- ‚úÖ **Acknowledge objections** (don't be defensive)

### Don't:
- ‚ùå **Lead with features** (listener doesn't care yet)
- ‚ùå **Over-promise** ("$1M Year 1!" = amateur flag)
- ‚ùå **Pitch without traction** (build demo first)
- ‚ùå **Assume listener knows games** (explain like to parent)
- ‚ùå **Be vague** ("We need some money" = instant no)
