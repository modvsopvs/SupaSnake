# Chapter 16: Experiences Can Be Judged by Their Interest Curves - Summary

**Edition:** 3rd Edition (2020)
**Relevance to SupaSnake:** CRITICAL - Session-based mobile play requires careful pacing; interest curves guide retention design

## Chapter Overview

Interest curves chart player interest over time. Good curve: Hook (grab attention) → Rising interest with rest periods → Grand finale (climax) → Resolution (leave them wanting more). Bad curve: No hook → Declining interest → Crosses interest threshold (player quits). Interest = Inherent Interest (drama, risk, novelty) + Poetry of Presentation (aesthetic beauty) + Projection (player puts self in experience). Curves can be fractal: overall game has curve, each session has curve, each round/challenge has curve. Half-Life 2 Episode 1 death graph shows ideal interest curve shape over 5.5-hour experience.

## Key Concepts Extracted

### Concept 1: Interest Curve Anatomy
**Ideal shape:**
- **(A) Initial Interest:** Players arrive with expectations (packaging, ads, friends)
- **(B) Hook:** Opening that grabs attention (musical opening number, guitar riff, ghost in Hamlet)
- **(C, E) Rising Peaks:** Interest builds with temporary peaks
- **(D, F) Rest Periods:** Brief valleys let players catch breath (contrast makes peaks feel higher)
- **(G) Grand Finale:** Climax more interesting than everything else
- **(H) Resolution:** End with interest still high ("leave them wanting more")

**Bad curve:** No hook → Declining interest → Crosses **interest threshold** (player quits) → Misses later good content

### Concept 2: Fractal Structure
Interest curve pattern appears at multiple scales:

**Level 1: Overall Game (Weeks/Months)**
- Intro movie → Series of levels → Final boss battle

**Level 2: Each Level (30-60 min)**
- New aesthetics → Series of challenges → Boss battle

**Level 3: Each Challenge (1-5 min)**
- Introduction → Rising difficulty → Completion

All follow same hook → rising → climax → resolution shape. Half-Life 2 Episode 1 example: death graph over 5.5 hours shows perfect curve at macro level.

### Concept 3: Three Interest Factors

**Factor 1: Inherent Interest**
- Some events naturally more interesting (risk > safety, unusual > ordinary, dramatic change)
- "Man wrestling alligator" > "Man eating cheese sandwich"
- Lens #70: What base/higher instincts does game appeal to? Anticipation of dramatic change?

**Factor 2: Poetry of Presentation**
- Aesthetics of artistry (writing, music, dance, acting, cinematography, graphic design)
- Beautiful presentation makes inherently boring content interesting
- Lens #71: How can each element be more beautiful? What does beauty mean in this game's context?

**Factor 3: Projection**
- Extent player uses empathy/imagination to put themselves in experience
- Events happening to you > events happening to friend > events happening to stranger
- Storytellers create empathetic characters; games let player BE the character
- Lens #72: What can players relate to? Imagine? Visit? Be? Do that they can't IRL?

### Concept 4: Interest Factor Examples

**Juggling Chainsaws:**
- Inherent Interest: HIGH (risk, danger)
- Poetry: LOW (street performer, limited artistry)
- Projection: MEDIUM (easy to imagine catching wrong end)

**Violin Concerto:**
- Inherent Interest: LOW (two sticks rubbed together)
- Poetry: HIGH (beautiful music carried the experience)
- Projection: LOW (unless music transports you, or you empathize with musician)

**Tetris:**
- Inherent Interest: LOW (falling blocks)
- Poetry: LOW (simple graphics, minimal music)
- Projection: HIGH (player makes all decisions, success/failure contingent on performance)

### Concept 5: Moments (Lens #68)
Interest curves chart the **top ten moments** of experience. Disney CEO question: "What are the top ten moments in your experience?" If you can't answer, pitch meeting is over. Memorable moments are stars that make up constellation of your interest curve.

### Concept 6: Pacing and Rest Periods
**Can't sustain peak interest continuously** (exhausting). Rest periods (valleys) serve multiple purposes:
- Let players catch breath
- Make peaks feel higher by contrast
- Process progress made
- Anticipate next peak

**Visible progress research:** Primary driver of mood in workplace AND games. People want yearly pay raises (visible progress) even if inflation neutralizes value. Inflation exists because psychological need for progress.

## Lenses Introduced

- **Lens #68: The Lens of Moments** - What are key moments? How to make each as powerful as possible?
- **Lens #69: The Lens of the Interest Curve** - Overall shape? Hook? Rising interest? Grand finale? Fractal structure?
- **Lens #70: The Lens of Inherent Interest** - What's immediately captivating? Novel? Appeals to base/higher instincts?
- **Lens #71: The Lens of Beauty** - How can elements be more beautiful? What does beauty mean in this context?
- **Lens #72: The Lens of Projection** - What can players relate to? Imagine? Places to visit? Characters to be? Actions they can't do IRL?

## SupaSnake Applications

**Fractal Curves (Three Levels):**

**Level 1: Overall Game (Weeks)**
- Hook: First variant unlock
- Rising: Complete first dynasty
- Climax: Unlock all 3 dynasties + Breeding Lab
- Resolution: Pursue 100% collection (Tyler's long-term goal)

**Level 2: Each Session (5-10 min for Emma, 60+ for Tyler)**
- Hook: Round 1 easy DNA
- Rising: Rounds 2-6 build difficulty
- Climax: Round 7 legendary chase
- Resolution: Energy depleted (natural stop point)

**Level 3: Each Round (60-90 sec)**
- Hook: First DNA orbs visible
- Rising: Speed increases (60% → 120%)
- Climax: High-speed legendary spawn
- Resolution: Death/completion + score display

**Top 10 Moments in SupaSnake:**
1. First DNA collection (initial satisfaction)
2. First variant unlock (reward revelation)
3. High-speed legendary chase (peak tension)
4. Near-miss wall collision (dramatic close call)
5. Session high score beat (personal achievement)
6. Dynasty completion (8/8 variants)
7. First successful breed (creation moment)
8. 100% collection (ultimate milestone)
9. Energy depletion decision (continue via ad?)
10. Returning after refill (anticipation)

**Interest Factors Balance:**

**Classic Mode Rounds:**
- Inherent Interest: HIGH (risk of death, high-speed chase)
- Poetry: MEDIUM (neon visuals, satisfying sounds)
- Projection: HIGH (Emma's high score, her collection)

**Collection Lab Browsing:**
- Inherent Interest: LOW (static browsing)
- Poetry: HIGH (Panini book aesthetic, beautiful card art)
- Projection: MEDIUM (Emma's personal collection)

**Pacing via Energy System:**
- 5-7 rounds create session curve with natural endpoint
- Prevents burnout (can't grind indefinitely)
- Emma quits at session peak (Round 7 climax), not trough (boredom)
- Returns tomorrow with anticipation (wanting more)

**Emma vs Tyler Curves:**

**Emma (Commuter - 5-10 min sessions):**
- Steep curve: 0 → Peak in 8 minutes
- Clean endpoint: Energy depletion = "good stopping point"
- Daily habit: Returns tomorrow (long-term curve via repetition)

**Tyler (Grinder - 60+ min sessions):**
- Multi-cycle curve: Chains energy refills
- Long-term visible: Collection progress (75% → 100%)
- Breeding Lab unlocks: Second wind after base collection complete
