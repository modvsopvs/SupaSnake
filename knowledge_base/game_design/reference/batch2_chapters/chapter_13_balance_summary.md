# Chapter 13: Game Mechanics Must Be in Balance - Summary

**Edition:** 3rd Edition (2020)
**Relevance to SupaSnake:** CRITICAL - Balance methodologies directly apply to DNA economy, gacha rates, progression curves

## Chapter Overview

Game balance is the art of adjusting game elements until they deliver the intended player experience. Unlike implementation (getting mechanics to work), balancing is subjective and experiential - a blend of mathematics and personal taste, like creating a recipe. Schell emphasizes that half of development time should be spent balancing after the game is functional.

The chapter presents twelve common balance types that recur across all games, though each game requires unique balancing approaches. Balance emerges from iterative playtesting where mathematical models inform prototypes, and prototype testing refines models.

## Key Concepts Extracted

### The Nature of Balance

**Core Principle:**
"Balancing a game is adjusting the elements until they deliver the experience you want."

**Model + Prototype Virtuous Circle:**
1. Create mathematical model of game relationships
2. Test prototype with real players
3. Model informs balance adjustments
4. Testing improves model accuracy
5. Iterate until model matches reality and experience feels right

**Timeline Reality:**
- Balancing only begins when game is playable
- Rule of thumb: 6 months to balance after working version
- Or: Half of total development time
- Many games fail commercially by shipping before proper balancing

### Balance Type #1: Fairness

**Symmetrical Games:**
- Equal resources/powers for all players
- Ensures no unfair advantages
- Good for measuring skill
- Examples: Chess, checkers, most sports

**Asymmetrical Games:**
- Different resources/powers per player
- Harder to balance but more interesting
- Reasons: Simulate reality, add variety, personalization, level playing field, create intrigue

**Balancing Method:**
- Assign numerical values to resources/powers
- Ensure totals equal across sides
- Playtest to validate model
- Example: Biplane Battle (Speed + Maneuverability + Firepower must total equally)

**Circular Balance (Rock-Paper-Scissors):**
- Each element has strength and weakness
- No element is supreme
- Prevents dominant strategies
- Common in fighting games, unit balancing

**SupaSnake Application:**
- Symmetrical core gameplay (all players start equal)
- Fair gacha RNG (same rates for everyone)
- Skill creates time advantage (fair), not power advantage (unfair)

### Balance Type #2: Challenge vs Success

**Flow Channel:**
- Too challenging → Frustration → Quit
- Too easy → Boredom → Quit
- Just right → Flow → Engagement

**Techniques:**
1. **Increase difficulty with success** (common pattern: harder levels)
2. **Let players skip easy parts** (skilled players advance faster)
3. **Layers of challenge** (grade system: C passes, A for mastery)
4. **Difficulty selection** (easy/medium/hard modes)
5. **Playtest variety** (novices AND experts)
6. **Give losers a break** (Mario Kart rubber-banding)

**Key Question:**
"What % of players do I want to complete this game?"
- Design progression curve for that target percentage

**First Level Exception:**
- Learning controls is challenging enough
- First levels should be trivially easy
- Early success builds confidence

**SupaSnake Application:**
- Natural difficulty ramp (snake length grows)
- Skill floor via participation DNA (beginners can progress)
- Skill ceiling via combo/length mechanics (experts rewarded)
- Energy gates prevent overwhelming grind (paces challenge)
- Target: 60-70% complete one dynasty, 30% complete all three

### Balance Type #3: Meaningful Choices

**Core Concept:**
Choices must impact outcome and matter to players.

**Dominant Strategy Problem:**
- If one choice is clearly best, no real choice exists
- Game becomes solved puzzle
- Players lose interest
- Must eliminate through balancing

**Choice Balancing:**
- Choices > Desires → Overwhelming
- Choices < Desires → Frustrating
- Choices = Desires → Freedom and fulfillment

**Triangularity (Special Pattern):**
- Player chooses: Safe/low-reward OR Risky/high-reward
- Use expected value to balance (risk × probability = reward)
- Example: Space Invaders flying saucer (difficult but high points)

**Expected Value Formula:**
Safe: 100% success × 10 points = 10 expected value
Risky: 50% success × 20 points = 10 expected value
Balanced choice (personal preference decides)

**SupaSnake Application:**
- Gacha vs Breeding (both viable, different trade-offs)
- Chase risky DNA vs collect safe DNA (triangularity)
- Pull now vs save for specific dynasty (resource management)
- No dominant strategy if breeding saves 15-20% time but requires planning

### Balance Type #4: Skill vs Chance

**Opposing Forces:**
- Too much skill → Stressful test (judgment)
- Too much chance → No control (luck)
- Different audiences prefer different balances

**Common Pattern:**
Alternate skill and chance (deal cards = chance, play cards = skill)

**Cultural Differences:**
- German players prefer minimal chance
- American players more tolerant of randomness
- Age/gender also influence preference

**David Perry's Addictive Formula:**
Players should always be: Exercising skill + Taking risks + Working strategy

**SupaSnake Application:**
- Core gameplay: 90% skill (Snake movement)
- Collection: 80% chance (gacha RNG)
- Separated systems prevent conflict
- Skill determines chance frequency (DNA earning rate)
- Appeals to both Emma (chance-lover) and Tyler (skill-lover)

---

### Balance Type #5: Head vs Hands

**Physical vs Mental:**
- Hands: Dexterity, button pressing, reflexes
- Head: Puzzle-solving, strategy, planning
- Most games blend both

**Communication Challenge:**
- Game must clearly communicate balance
- Pac-Man 2 failed by appearing action (hands) but being puzzle (head)
- Misleading presentation → Wrong audience

**SupaSnake Application:**
- Hands: Touch control, timing, reflexes (30%)
- Head: Route planning, risk assessment, breeding strategy (70%)
- Clearly communicated through UI (Snake = action, Labs = strategy)

---

### Balance Type #6: Competition vs Cooperation

**Basic Urges:**
- Competition: Establish status, measure skill
- Cooperation: Team power, diverse abilities

**Blended Approaches:**
- Team competition (best of both)
- Joust pattern (can compete OR cooperate dynamically)
- Alternating modes (cooperative waves, competitive waves)

**SupaSnake Application:**
- V0.1: Pure solo (no competition/cooperation)
- V1.0 potential: Leaderboards (implicit competition)
- V2.0 potential: Trading variants (cooperation)

### Additional Balance Types (Briefly Mentioned)

**7. Short vs Long:** Session length vs total completion time
**8. Rewards:** Intrinsic vs extrinsic, frequency, value
**9. Punishment:** Consequences of failure
**10. Freedom vs Control:** Sandbox vs linear
**11. Simple vs Complex:** Learn vs master
**12. Detail vs Imagination:** Explicit vs implied

Each requires specific balancing based on target experience.

## SupaSnake Applications

**Critical Balancing Challenges:**

**1. DNA Economy (Fairness + Challenge):**
- Must feel achievable for beginners (fairness)
- Must reward experts with faster progress (meaningful skill difference)
- Must maintain engagement across 60+ hours (pacing)
- Balance method: Mathematical model → Playtest → Adjust → Repeat

**2. Gacha Rates (Chance + Meaningful Choice):**
- Must excite with rare drops (chance creates fun)
- Must feel fair over time (pity systems, duplicate protection)
- Must compete with breeding (no dominant strategy)
- Balance method: Simulation of 10,000 players, validate with real players

**3. Skill vs Chance Hybrid (Type #4):**
- Separate systems (Snake = skill, Collection = chance)
- Skill affects frequency, not outcomes
- Emotional attribution kept clean (skill failure ≠ bad luck)
- Balance method: Track retention by player type (Emma vs Tyler)

**4. Progression Curve (Challenge vs Success):**
- Week 1: Fast progress (10-15 variants, motivation)
- Week 2-3: Moderate pacing (building collection)
- Week 4+: Slowing but visible end (completion satisfaction)
- Balance method: Coupon collector problem + playtesting

**5. Energy Gates (Freedom vs Control):**
- Freedom: Play anytime, master at own pace
- Control: Sessions limited by energy regen
- Balance: 10 energy cap, 1 per 8 min (allows 2-3 sessions/day for casuals, all-day for hardcore)
- Balance method: Track session frequency, adjust regen rate

**Balancing Process for SupaSnake:**
1. **Month 1-2:** Build functional prototype
2. **Month 3-4:** Create mathematical models (DNA economy spreadsheet)
3. **Month 4-6:** Intensive playtesting (50+ players, diverse skill levels)
4. **Month 6+:** Iterative refinement (change one variable at a time)
5. **Launch:** Final polish, lock balance, plan live-ops adjustments
