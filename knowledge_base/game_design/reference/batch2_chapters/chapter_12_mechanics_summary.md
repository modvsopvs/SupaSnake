# Chapter 12: Some Elements Are Game Mechanics - Summary

**Edition:** 3rd Edition (2020)
**Relevance to SupaSnake:** HIGH - Core mechanics directly apply to Snake gameplay + collection design

## Chapter Overview

Schell presents the seven fundamental game mechanics that define what games truly are when stripped of aesthetics. Mechanics are "the interactions and relationships that remain when all aesthetics, technology, and story are removed." Understanding mechanics through this lens enables designers to manipulate core gameplay without distraction.

The chapter emphasizes emergent gameplay - when simple mechanics interact to create complex strategic possibilities. The ratio of strategic actions to basic actions measures a game's elegant depth.

## Key Concepts Extracted

### Mechanic 1: Space

**Core Idea:** The abstract mathematical space where gameplay occurs, stripped of visuals.

**Classifications:**
- Discrete vs Continuous (grid cells vs smooth coordinates)
- Dimensionality (0D, 1D, 2D, 3D)
- Bounded vs Unbounded, Connected vs Separated
- Nested spaces (spaces within spaces)

**SupaSnake Application:**
- Discrete 2D grid (15×20 cells)
- Clear boundaries (walls)
- Snake occupies cells, not pixel positions
- Matches mental model (grid-based thinking)

### Mechanic 2: Time

**Core Idea:** How time flows and is controlled in the game space.

**Types:**
- Discrete (turn-based) vs Continuous (real-time)
- Clocks (absolute time limits)
- Races (relative speed competitions)
- Time control (pause, rewind, speed up)

**SupaSnake Application:**
- Continuous time (Snake moves in real-time)
- Implicit race (chase DNA before snake gets too long)
- No time control (pure action, no pause mid-run)

**Note:** Less critical for SupaSnake than other mechanics (continuous real-time is standard for Snake)

### Mechanic 3: Objects

**Core Idea:** The "nouns" of games - things that exist in space with attributes and states.

**Key Components:**
- Objects have attributes (categories of information)
- Attributes have states (current values)
- States can be static or dynamic
- State machines diagram possible state transitions
- Communicate state changes clearly to players

**SupaSnake Application:**
- Snake object (length, direction, alive/dead states)
- DNA object (position, collected state)
- Variant object (dynasty, rarity, generation, owned state)
- Clear visual feedback for all state changes

### Mechanic 4: Actions

**Core Idea:** The "verbs" of games - what players can do.

**Two Types:**
- Basic Actions: Direct player inputs (move, jump, shoot)
- Strategic Actions: Higher-level combinations toward goals (flanking, baiting)

**Emergent Gameplay (5 Tips):**
1. Add more verbs (but maintain elegance)
2. Verbs that act on many objects (gun shoots enemies, locks, windows)
3. Goals achievable multiple ways (shoot boss OR drop chandelier)
4. Many subjects (multiple pieces that coordinate)
5. Side effects that change constraints (every move changes board state)

**SupaSnake Application:**
- 4 basic actions (move, eat, gacha pull, breed)
- 8+ strategic actions (combo chains, risk management, generation planning)
- Excellent ratio (~2:1 strategic:basic)
- Emergence from growth mechanic (length changes navigation constraints)

### Mechanic 5: Rules

**Core Idea:** The foundation that defines everything - space, time, objects, actions, goals.

**Parlett's Rule Types:**
- **Operational:** What players do to play (most important)
- **Foundational:** Mathematical structure underneath
- **Behavioral:** Implicit good sportsmanship
- **Written:** Documentation
- **Laws:** Tournament clarifications
- **House Rules:** Player modifications

**Goal Design (The Most Important Rule):**
- Goals must be **concrete** (clearly stated)
- Goals must be **achievable** (players believe they can win)
- Goals must be **rewarding** (valuable before and after achievement)

**Computer Enforcement:**
- Videogames can enforce rules automatically
- Turns rules into physical constraints
- Enables complexity without memorization burden

**SupaSnake Application:**
- Operational: Move, collect DNA, avoid collision
- Goal hierarchy: Complete level (immediate), earn DNA for pull (session), complete dynasty (long-term)
- Computer enforcement handles collision, DNA tracking, gacha RNG
- Tutorial teaches operationally, not through written rules

### Mechanic 6: Skill

**Core Idea:** What abilities players must exercise to succeed.

**Three Skill Categories:**
- **Physical:** Dexterity, coordination, timing, endurance
- **Mental:** Memory, observation, puzzle-solving, decision-making
- **Social:** Reading opponents, deception, communication, teamwork

**Real vs Virtual Skills:**
- Real Skills: Player must possess (reaction time, pattern recognition)
- Virtual Skills: Character progression (level ups, stat increases)
- Best games balance both

**SupaSnake Application:**
- Real Skills: Touch control, spatial planning, timing, risk assessment, resource management
- Virtual Skills: Snake length (temporary power), collection progress (permanent achievement)
- Dominant skills: Spatial planning (40%), timing (30%), risk assessment (20%)
- Mastery curve: Hour 1 (survive 20s) → Hour 100 (perfect 90s runs)

### Mechanic 7: Chance

**Core Idea:** Uncertainty creates surprise, surprise creates fun.

**Why Chance Matters:**
- Prevents perfect predictability
- Balances skill disparities
- Creates memorable moments
- Adds replayability

**Probability Fundamentals (Schell's 10 Rules):**
- Fractions = Decimals = Percents
- Range: 0-100% only
- Probability = "Looked for" ÷ Total possible outcomes
- Enumerate when possible
- OR means ADD (mutually exclusive events)
- AND means MULTIPLY (independent events)

**Balancing Skill vs Chance:**
- Too much skill = stressful test
- Too much chance = no control
- Common pattern: Alternate (deal cards = chance, play cards = skill)

**SupaSnake Application:**
- Core gameplay: 90% skill, 10% chance (DNA spawn location)
- Collection: 20% skill (earning efficiency), 80% chance (gacha RNG)
- Hybrid design satisfies both casual (chance-lovers) and hardcore (skill-lovers)
- Skill controls chance frequency, not outcomes (fair advantage)

## SupaSnake Applications

**Mechanic Synergy:**
- Space (discrete grid) + Time (continuous) = Classic Snake feel
- Objects (variants) + Chance (gacha) = Collection excitement
- Actions (move, pull, breed) + Rules (collision, cost) = Clear gameplay loop
- Skill (Snake mastery) + Chance (RNG drops) = Hybrid appeal

**Emergent Depth:**
- Simple basic actions (4 total)
- Complex strategic possibilities (8+)
- Ratio of 2:1 indicates elegant design
- Growth mechanic creates self-imposed difficulty curve

**Balance Priorities:**
1. Keep skill and chance in separate systems (don't mix)
2. Maintain clear goals at all time scales (immediate, session, long-term)
3. Ensure state changes communicate clearly (owned variants, DNA earned, length growing)
4. Design for both Emma (chance-focused) and Tyler (skill-focused)
