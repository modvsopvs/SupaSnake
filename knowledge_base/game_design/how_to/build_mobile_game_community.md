# How to Build a Mobile Game Community

**Goal**: Launch and grow a healthy, self-sustaining player community for SupaSnake with minimal developer overhead (1-2 hours/week).

**Timeline**: Pre-launch (4 weeks) ‚Üí Soft Launch (8 weeks) ‚Üí Post-Launch (ongoing)

**Prerequisites**:
- Game in TestFlight beta (playable, even if rough)
- Twitter/X account created
- 10-20 friends/family willing to test

---

## Step 1: Pre-Launch Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

**Goal**: Create basic infrastructure before players arrive.

### Create Community Platforms

**Subreddit** (15 minutes):
1. Create `/r/SupaSnake` (or `/r/YourGameName`)
2. Write sidebar description: "SupaSnake is a mobile snake collecting game. Breed rare variants, complete your collection, and share strategies!"
3. Create 5 post flairs: "Guide", "Showcase", "Discussion", "Bug Report", "Suggestion"
4. Set rules (3-5 simple rules):
   - Be respectful
   - No real-money trading
   - Mark spoilers
   - No self-promotion without permission
   - Follow Reddit content policy

**Discord Server** (30 minutes):
1. Create server, set icon/banner
2. Create 5 channels:
   - `#announcements` (read-only, dev posts only)
   - `#general` (main chat)
   - `#breeding-strategies` (guides, tips)
   - `#showcase` (rare pulls, collection screenshots)
   - `#feedback` (bugs, suggestions)
3. Set up AutoMod (Discord Safety Setup):
   - Block spam links automatically
   - Filter profanity (medium setting)
   - New member timeout (10 minutes before posting)
4. Create welcome message in `#general`:
   ```
   Welcome to SupaSnake! üêç

   **What is this?**
   Mobile snake collecting game - breed rare variants, complete your collection!

   **Where to start?**
   - Download TestFlight: [link]
   - Read beginner guide: [subreddit link]
   - Ask questions in #general

   **Rules:**
   - Be respectful
   - No real-money trading
   - No spam

   Developer checks Discord once per day. Help each other out!
   ```

**Twitter/X** (10 minutes):
1. Bio: "Solo dev building SupaSnake üêç Mobile snake collecting game. Breed rare variants, complete your collection. TestFlight soon!"
2. Pin tweet: GIF of breeding animation + "Working on SupaSnake - a mobile snake collecting game. Follow for dev updates!"
3. Follow 20-30 indie game devs, mobile game communities

### Seed Initial Content

**Write 5 FAQs** (2 hours total):
1. "What is SupaSnake?" (game overview, core loop)
2. "How does breeding work?" (basic formula, inheritance)
3. "How do I earn DNA?" (daily rewards, gameplay, IAP)
4. "What are the rarest variants?" (tier list, probabilities)
5. "Roadmap & Future Plans" (upcoming dynasties, features)

Post these to subreddit, pin top 2.

**Create Beginner Guide Doc** (1 hour):
- Google Doc or Notion page (publicly viewable)
- "SupaSnake Beginner's Guide": tutorial walkthrough, early strategies, common mistakes
- Link in Discord welcome message, subreddit sidebar

### Recruit Founding Players

**Friends/Family Beta** (10-20 people):
1. Send TestFlight invite to friends/family
2. Personal message: "I'm building a mobile game, would you try it and give honest feedback? No obligation to love it!"
3. Invite to Discord (but don't require it)
4. Ask for feedback after 3 days of play

**Goal**: Learn what confuses players, what excites them, what's broken.

---

## Step 2: Soft Launch (Weeks 5-12)

**Goal**: Grow to 100-500 players, establish community culture.

### Public Beta Announcement

**Twitter Launch Thread** (Week 5):
```
üêç SupaSnake is now in public beta!

Collect & breed rare snake variants
üß¨ Genetic inheritance system
üé® Beautiful 3D snakes
üì± Free to play (TestFlight)

Link: [TestFlight link]

Feedback welcome! #indiedev #mobilegames [GIF]
```

**Reddit Posts** (Week 5):
- Post to `/r/incremental_games`, `/r/AndroidGaming`, `/r/iOSGaming` (read rules first!)
- Title: "I made a snake collecting game with breeding mechanics - free TestFlight beta"
- Include GIF, link to subreddit + TestFlight

**Discord Invite** (Week 5):
- Add Discord invite link to game's settings menu
- Add to Twitter bio
- Track joins via Discord analytics

### Establish Community Culture Early

**First 50 Players are Critical**:
- Personally welcome each player in Discord (first 2 weeks)
- Thank bug reporters publicly ("Great catch, @Username! Fixed in next build")
- Feature first player-created guide: "Shoutout to @Player for this amazing breeding calculator!"

**Celebrate Milestones**:
- "We hit 50 Discord members! Here's a thank-you exclusive variant code: COMMUNITY50"
- "First player to complete Serpens Dynasty! Congrats @Winner!"
- Retweet fan art, showcase screenshots on Twitter

**Set Expectations**:
- "I'm a solo dev - check Discord once per day, respond to critical bugs ASAP"
- "Community roadmap is suggestions, not promises - I prioritize based on data + vision"
- "Volunteer moderators welcome - DM me if interested!"

### Empower Volunteer Moderators

**When**: 200+ Discord members OR 10+ hours/week spent on moderation

**How to Recruit** (Week 8-10):
1. Identify helpful, active, positive community members (top 3-5 people)
2. DM: "Hey! You've been super helpful in the community. Would you be interested in being a volunteer moderator? No payment, but you'd get an exclusive Moderator variant as a thank-you. Time commitment ~2 hours/week."
3. If yes, create mod role with permissions:
   - Timeout users (1 hour to 1 week)
   - Delete messages/spam
   - Pin important messages
   - Cannot ban permanently (only dev can)

**Mod Guidelines Document**:
```markdown
# SupaSnake Moderation Guidelines

## Your Powers
- Timeout (1 hour to 1 week)
- Delete spam/off-topic posts
- Pin/unpin messages

## When to Timeout
- Spam: Instant 1-hour timeout, delete messages
- Mild toxicity ("This game sucks"): 1-hour timeout, warning
- Repeated offense: 1-day timeout, escalate to dev
- Harassment/doxxing: Immediate escalate to dev (permanent ban)

## When to Escalate to Dev
- Permanent ban decisions
- Policy questions (new rules, gray areas)
- Player disputes you can't resolve

## Weekly Sync
- Async check-in in #mod-chat every Monday
- Dev reviews mod actions, answers questions
```

### Run First Community Event

**Week 10: "Rarest Pull" Contest**:
1. Announce: "Post your rarest variant screenshot this week - best pull wins 500 DNA!"
2. Create `#event-submissions` channel temporarily
3. Players post screenshots with rarity %
4. Friday: Pick winner, award DNA via promo code
5. Feature all submissions on Twitter: "Look at these amazing pulls from our community!"

**Why Events Work**:
- Drive engagement (spike in Discord activity)
- Generate content (screenshots for social media)
- Build tradition ("Monthly event every first week")

---

## Step 3: Post-Launch Growth (Ongoing)

**Goal**: Self-sustaining community (players help each other, dev time <2 hours/week).

### Weekly Developer Routine (1-2 Hours Total)

**Monday (30 minutes)**:
- Check Discord for critical issues (crashes, exploits)
- Review top 3 upvoted suggestions on subreddit
- Respond to @mentions on Twitter
- Quick "What's up this week" post in Discord announcements

**Wednesday (30 minutes)**:
- Respond to non-urgent Discord questions
- Review volunteer mod actions (Discord audit log)
- Thank guide creators, retweet fan art

**Friday (30 minutes)**:
- "This Week in SupaSnake" summary post:
  ```
  This week:
  ‚úÖ Fixed 3 bugs (thanks @BugReporter1, @BugReporter2!)
  üé® Working on new dynasty art
  üìä 1,234 active players this week (+5%)

  Next week: New variants drop Tuesday!
  ```
- Schedule next week's event (if doing monthly events)

**Optional Sunday (30 minutes)**:
- "Developer Q&A" - answer 5-10 community questions via Reddit thread
- Not every week, only when you have time/energy

### Community Health Check (Monthly, 15 Minutes)

**Metrics to Track**:
1. **Discord Activity**:
   - Messages per week (target: 200+)
   - Active members (target: 10%+ of total)
   - New joins vs. leaves (target: net positive)

2. **Content Creation**:
   - New guides posted (target: 1+ per month)
   - Fan art / showcase posts (target: 5+ per week)
   - Player-answered questions (target: 50%+ answered by community, not dev)

3. **Sentiment**:
   - Positive vs. negative feedback ratio (target: 80%+ positive/neutral)
   - Upvote ratio on patch announcements (target: 90%+)

**Red Flags**:
- Discord dead for 3+ days (need event or announcement)
- No new guides in 2+ months (community not engaged enough)
- Majority of questions unanswered (need to recruit more knowledgeable members)
- Negative sentiment spike (investigate: bad patch? Economy nerf?)

### Scaling Community (1,000+ Players)

**Upgrade Discord**:
- Add role-based channels (verified players get access after linking game account)
- Create dynasty-specific channels (#serpens-strategies, #aqualis-breeding)
- Community server boost perks (higher upload limit for screenshots)

**Upgrade Moderation**:
- 5-10 volunteer moderators across time zones
- Weekly mod meeting (30 minutes, async via voice channel recording)
- Mod-only resources (banned user database, common scam patterns)

**Launch Community Wiki**:
- Let community create Fandom wiki (or use Notion)
- Don't force it - if players want it, they'll build it
- Feature best wiki pages in Discord/Twitter

**Partner Content Creators**:
- Reach out to mobile gaming YouTubers (5k-50k subs, not mega-channels)
- Offer early access to new dynasties in exchange for video coverage
- Don't pay for promotion (unless revenue justifies it)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Over-Promising in Community

**Bad**:
```
Dev: "Multiplayer trading coming next month!"
[3 months later, still not shipped]
Community: "You promised trading!"
```

**Good**:
```
Dev: "Multiplayer trading is on the roadmap for Q3-Q4, no promises on exact timing. I'll keep you posted!"
[If delayed]: "Trading pushed to Q1 next year - turns out it's more complex than I thought. Thanks for your patience!"
```

**Lesson**: Roadmaps are suggestions, not commitments. Under-promise, over-deliver.

---

### Mistake 2: Arguing with Negative Feedback

**Bad**:
```
Player: "DNA prices are too high, this is pay-to-win garbage"
Dev: "Actually, you can earn 100 DNA per day F2P, so it's not P2W. Maybe you're just impatient."
```

**Good**:
```
Player: "DNA prices are too high, this is pay-to-win garbage"
Dev: "Thanks for the feedback! I'm tracking economy sentiment - if lots of players feel this way, I'll adjust pricing. What DNA price would feel fair to you?"
```

**Lesson**: Acknowledge, don't defend. Players want to be heard, not debated.

---

### Mistake 3: Neglecting Positive Players

**Bad**:
- Only respond to bug reports and complaints
- Positive posts ignored
- Helpful players never acknowledged

**Good**:
- Thank guide creators publicly
- Feature rare pull screenshots on Twitter
- Give exclusive variant codes to top community contributors
- Monthly "Player Spotlight" in Discord

**Lesson**: What you reward, you get more of. Celebrate positivity.

---

### Mistake 4: Doing Everything Yourself

**Bad**:
- Developer moderates 24/7 (burnout in 3 months)
- Developer writes all guides (community passive)
- Developer organizes all events (exhausting)

**Good**:
- Recruit 2-3 volunteer mods by month 2
- Celebrate first player-written guide like it's a holiday
- Let players organize fan events ("Screenshot Sunday" started by community member)

**Lesson**: Empower community to run itself. Your job is to build the game, not be the community.
