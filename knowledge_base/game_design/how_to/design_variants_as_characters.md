# How to Design Variants as Characters

**Goal**: Create snake variants that function as collectible characters with distinct personalities players connect with emotionally.

**Timeline**: 3-5 days per variant (concept, design, testing, refinement)

**Prerequisites**:
- Understanding of @knowledge_base/game_design/quick_ref/concept_character_design.md
- Dynasty world identity (see @knowledge_base/game_design/how_to/design_dynasty_worlds.md)
- Visual design tools and skills

---

## Step 1: Define Character Purpose

**Before designing visuals, understand WHY this character exists.**

**Character Purpose Checklist:**

**Gameplay Function:**
- What rarity tier? (Common/Uncommon/Rare/Epic/Legendary)
- What breeding role? (Foundation parent, hybrid target, end-goal)
- What progression stage? (Early game, mid-game, end-game)

**Emotional Function:**
- What should player feel when they see this variant? (cute, powerful, mysterious, cool)
- What player archetype is this for? (Emma = casual collector, Tyler = hardcore achiever)
- What collection moment does this represent? (first snake, first rare, completion reward)

**Dynasty Function:**
- What aspect of dynasty does this express? (core identity, sub-theme, hybrid bridge)
- What role in dynasty hierarchy? (citizen, elite, leader)
- What world depth does this show? (surface, deeper, core mythology)

**Example - "Serpent King" Purpose:**

```
GAMEPLAY FUNCTION:
- Rarity: Legendary
- Breeding: Ultimate PRIMAL dynasty goal
- Progression: End-game achievement (6-12 hour pursuit)

EMOTIONAL FUNCTION:
- Player Feeling: Awe, accomplishment, pride
- Target: Tyler (hardcore collector who values status)
- Collection Moment: Completing PRIMAL dynasty centerpiece

DYNASTY FUNCTION:
- Dynasty Aspect: Ultimate PRIMAL expression (ancient ruler, primal power)
- Hierarchy: Leader/patriarch of PRIMAL realm
- World Depth: Core mythology (ancient serpent king legend)
```

**Purpose Statement Template:**

```
[VARIANT NAME] exists to:
1. Serve as [gameplay function]
2. Make players feel [emotion]
3. Represent [dynasty concept]
```

**Example**: "Serpent King exists to serve as PRIMAL legendary completion goal, make players feel accomplished and awed, and represent the ancient ruler archetype of PRIMAL dynasty."

---

## Step 2: Develop Character Personality

**Variants are silent characters - personality comes from visual design, not dialogue.**

**Personality Development Process:**

**A. Choose 3-5 Core Adjectives**

Pick words that describe this character's personality.

**CYBER Variant Example - "Neon Serpent":**
```
PERSONALITY ADJECTIVES:
1. Energetic
2. Flashy
3. Modern
4. Attention-seeking
5. Playful
```

**PRIMAL Variant Example - "Stone Guardian":**
```
PERSONALITY ADJECTIVES:
1. Ancient
2. Protective
3. Patient
4. Powerful
5. Wise
```

**COSMIC Variant Example - "Stellar Wanderer":**
```
PERSONALITY ADJECTIVES:
1. Mysterious
2. Distant
3. Serene
4. Ethereal
5. Contemplative
```

**B. Create Character Archetype**

What role does this character play in stories?

**Common Character Archetypes:**

| Archetype | Personality | Visual Cues | SupaSnake Example |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **The Leader** | Commanding, authoritative | Crown, large size, regal patterns | Serpent King (PRIMAL) |
| **The Warrior** | Fierce, battle-hardened | Scars, sharp features, aggressive pose | Battle Viper (PRIMAL) |
| **The Trickster** | Playful, mischievous | Bright colors, asymmetric patterns, cheeky expression | Glitch Snake (CYBER) |
| **The Sage** | Wise, mystical | Complex patterns, glowing elements, serene pose | Cosmic Oracle (COSMIC) |
| **The Innocent** | Cute, approachable | Large eyes, rounded features, soft colors | Common starters |
| **The Hero** | Brave, aspirational | Dynamic pose, shining elements, confident | Epic tier variants |

**C. Write Implied Backstory**

Players won't read this, but YOU need it to design consistently.

**Backstory Template:**
```
ORIGIN: Where did this variant come from?
JOURNEY: What has this variant experienced?
PRESENT: What is this variant doing now?
FUTURE: What does this variant aspire to?
```

**Example - "Serpent King" Backstory:**
```
ORIGIN: Ancient ruler of serpent kind, born in the first age of PRIMAL dynasty
JOURNEY: Survived countless eons, witnessed rise and fall of civilizations, protected PRIMAL realm
PRESENT: Regal patriarch watching over PRIMAL dynasty, rare to encounter
FUTURE: Eternal guardian ensuring PRIMAL values endure forever
```

**This backstory informs design:**
- ORIGIN → Ancient, timeless aesthetic (weathered, not new)
- JOURNEY → Battle-hardened details (scars, worn crown)
- PRESENT → Regal, commanding presence (large, imposing)
- FUTURE → Protective stance (guardian, not aggressive)

---

## Step 3: Design Visual Character

**Translate personality into visual form.**

**A. Silhouette Design**

**Principle**: Character should be recognizable from shadow alone.

**Silhouette Process:**

1. **Sketch 5-10 Rough Silhouettes** (black shapes on white background)
   - Focus on overall shape, not details
   - Exaggerate distinctive features
   - Test readability

2. **Test Recognition**
   - Show silhouettes to others
   - Ask: "Can you tell these apart?"
   - Keep only distinctive silhouettes

3. **Select Strongest Silhouette**
   - Most memorable shape
   - Supports personality
   - Distinct from other variants

**Silhouette Examples:**

**Serpent King (PRIMAL Legendary):**
```
┌──────────────────────┐
│                       │
│    ╱╲    Crown-like  │  ← Distinctive horn/crown shape
│   ╱  ╲   horns       │
│  │    │              │
│  │    │  Large,      │  ← Imposing body
│  │    │  thick       │
│  │    │  body        │
│   \  /               │
│    \/   Wide         │  ← Powerful tail
│    /\   tail         │
└──────────────────────┘
INSTANT READ: "Big, crowned, regal"
```

**Neon Serpent (CYBER Rare):**
```
┌──────────────────────┐
│                       │
│   ○  Larger          │  ← Oversized head (curious)
│  ╱│╲ head            │
│ │ │ │ Sleek,         │  ← Streamlined body
│ │ │ │ modern         │
│ └─┘ body             │
│  |||                 │
│  |||  Glowing        │  ← Visual "speed lines"
│  |||  elements       │
└──────────────────────┘
INSTANT READ: "Fast, modern, flashy"
```

**B. Feature Exaggeration**

**Principle**: Amplify features that express personality.

**Exaggeration Guide:**

| Personality | Exaggerate | Example |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Powerful** | Body size, muscle definition | Thick coils, large presence |
| **Cute** | Head size, eye size | Big head, big eyes, small body |
| **Mysterious** | Shadows, hidden elements | Partially obscured, flowing forms |
| **Energetic** | Bright colors, motion lines | Oversaturated colors, dynamic pose |
| **Ancient** | Weathering, size | Cracks, wear, imposing scale |
| **Elegant** | Length, flowing lines | Extended body, graceful curves |

**Example - "Stone Guardian" (PRIMAL Epic):**

**Personality**: Ancient, protective, powerful

**Exaggerations**:
- **Ancient** → Exaggerate weathering (deep cracks, worn patterns, aged texture)
- **Protective** → Exaggerate defensive features (thick scales, shield-like plates, coiled stance)
- **Powerful** → Exaggerate size (wide body, heavy presence, imposing)

**Result**: Massive snake with deeply weathered stone texture, thick protective scales, coiled in guardian stance.

**C. Color Psychology Application**

**Use colors to communicate personality instantly.**

**Color-Personality Matrix:**

**Warm Colors (Energy, Aggression, Attention):**
- **Red**: Danger, power, aggression, passion
- **Orange**: Energy, playfulness, warmth, enthusiasm
- **Yellow**: Joy, optimism, attention, caution

**Cool Colors (Calm, Intelligence, Mystery):**
- **Blue**: Technology, trust, calm, intelligence
- **Purple**: Mystery, royalty, spirituality, luxury
- **Green**: Nature, growth, harmony, tech (neon)

**Neutral Colors (Sophistication, Grounding):**
- **Black**: Power, mystery, elegance, sophistication
- **White**: Purity, simplicity, divinity, space
- **Gray**: Neutral, industrial, stone, balance

**Dynasty Color Integration:**

**CYBER Variants:**
- Base: Electric blues (tech, modern)
- Accent: Neon colors (energy, synthetic)
- Personality Variation:
  - Aggressive CYBER: Add red accents (danger + tech)
  - Playful CYBER: Add magenta/pink (fun + tech)
  - Elite CYBER: Add white/silver (prestige + tech)

**PRIMAL Variants:**
- Base: Earthy browns/greens (nature, ancient)
- Accent: Stone grays, blood reds (power, battle)
- Personality Variation:
  - Wise PRIMAL: Deeper earth tones (age, wisdom)
  - Fierce PRIMAL: Bright red accents (aggression)
  - Mystical PRIMAL: Add deep greens (nature magic)

**COSMIC Variants:**
- Base: Deep purples/blues (space, mystery)
- Accent: Stellar whites, nebula pinks (celestial)
- Personality Variation:
  - Serene COSMIC: Soft purples (peaceful mystery)
  - Powerful COSMIC: Bright whites (stellar power)
  - Mysterious COSMIC: Very deep purples (unknown depths)

**D. Pattern as Personality**

**Patterns reveal character through visual language.**

**Pattern Personality Guide:**

**Geometric Patterns** (Order, Control, Technology):
- Perfect grids: Precise, controlled, technological
- Circuits: Intelligent, connected, systematic
- Hexagons: Efficiency, structure, modern

**Organic Patterns** (Nature, Chaos, Life):
- Irregular scales: Natural, authentic, primal
- Flowing vines: Growth, life, adaptation
- Fractals: Complexity, nature's intelligence

**Symbolic Patterns** (Meaning, Culture, Mysticism):
- Tribal symbols: Heritage, tradition, power
- Sacred geometry: Mysticism, harmony, transcendence
- Constellations: Destiny, cosmic connection

**Example - "Data Weaver" (CYBER Uncommon):**

**Personality**: Intelligent, connected, systematic

**Pattern Choice**: Flowing circuit patterns that resemble data streams
- Not static grid (too rigid for "weaver" concept)
- Not random (too chaotic for "systematic")
- Solution: Circuit traces that flow like weaving threads (combines tech + movement)

**Pattern communicates**: "This snake is about data flow and connection, not just raw processing"

**E. Expression and Pose**

**Even without facial features, pose and eyes convey emotion.**

**Eye Design:**

**Eye Personality:**
- **Large, round eyes**: Cute, innocent, approachable (Commons)
- **Narrow, intense eyes**: Fierce, focused, aggressive (Warriors)
- **Glowing eyes**: Powerful, mysterious, supernatural (Epics/Legendaries)
- **Hidden/shadowed eyes**: Mysterious, secretive, enigmatic
- **Geometric eyes**: Robotic, synthetic, technological (CYBER)

**Body Language:**

**Poses Express Character:**
- **Coiled tight**: Defensive, cautious, protective
- **Extended upward**: Confident, proud, commanding
- **Curved playfully**: Friendly, approachable, playful
- **Rigid/straight**: Serious, formal, disciplined
- **Flowing loosely**: Relaxed, serene, ethereal

**Example Pose Analysis:**

**"Serpent King" (Commanding, Regal):**
```
Pose: Extended upward, head high, slight S-curve
Meaning: Proud, commanding presence, confident authority
Eye Expression: Intense but not aggressive (leadership, not tyranny)
```

**"Neon Serpent" (Energetic, Playful):**
```
Pose: Dynamic curve, slightly off-center, head tilted
Meaning: Energetic, ready to move, playful curiosity
Eye Expression: Wide, bright, alert (eager and excited)
```

---

## Step 4: Add Character Details

**Small details reinforce personality and create depth.**

**Detail Strategy by Rarity:**

**Commons:**
- **Detail Level**: Simple, clean, readable
- **Purpose**: Approachable, easy to understand
- **Example**: Basic circuit pattern on CYBER common

**Uncommons:**
- **Detail Level**: One distinctive detail that shows personality
- **Purpose**: Memorable, shows character
- **Example**: Unique data stream flow pattern

**Rares:**
- **Detail Level**: Multiple interesting details, cohesive
- **Purpose**: Reward close inspection, strong personality
- **Example**: Pulsing neon strips + flowing circuit traces + holographic elements

**Epics:**
- **Detail Level**: Complex, layered, rich
- **Purpose**: Impressive, worth displaying, high production value
- **Example**: Multi-layer holographic effects + particle trails + animated circuits

**Legendaries:**
- **Detail Level**: Maximum polish, every pixel intentional
- **Purpose**: Iconic, god-tier, unforgettable
- **Example**: Crown with intricate tribal carvings + battle scars telling stories + royal patterns + imposing scale

**Detail Types:**

**Functional Details** (Support character function):
- Legendary crown → Shows leadership status
- Battle scars → Shows warrior backstory
- Glowing core → Shows power level
- Data streams → Shows tech nature

**Personality Details** (Express character traits):
- Playful asymmetry → Trickster personality
- Perfect symmetry → Order/control personality
- Weathering/age → Ancient/wise personality
- Pristine/clean → New/pure personality

**World Details** (Reinforce dynasty):
- Tribal markings → PRIMAL dynasty
- Circuit traces → CYBER dynasty
- Star patterns → COSMIC dynasty

**Example - "Serpent King" Details:**

**Functional**:
- Crown/horns → Leadership (you know this is important)
- Large size → Power (imposing presence)
- Royal patterns → Status (this is special)

**Personality**:
- Battle scars → Experienced, survived conflicts
- Weathered texture → Ancient, timeless
- Calm eyes → Wise, not cruel

**World**:
- Tribal carvings in crown → PRIMAL dynasty
- Natural stone texture → PRIMAL world
- Earthy color palette → PRIMAL identity

**All details work together to say: "Ancient, powerful, wise leader of PRIMAL dynasty"**

## Step 5: Design Character Behavior

**Bring character to life through animations and interactions.**

**Idle Animation (Primary Character Expression)**

**Animation Personality:**

| Personality | Idle Behavior | Example |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| **Curious** | Look around, investigate | Neon Serpent peers at edges of screen |
| **Sleepy** | Yawn, rest, minimal movement | Lazy commons barely move |
| **Energetic** | Constant motion, bouncing | CYBER variants pulse/flicker |
| **Regal** | Minimal, dignified movement | Serpent King slowly sways |
| **Mysterious** | Fade in/out, ethereal motion | COSMIC variants shimmer |
| **Aggressive** | Coiling, ready to strike | Battle variants stay tense |

**Breeding Animation (Character Relationship)**

**How does this variant approach breeding?**

- **Eager variants**: Quick to engage, excited particle effects
- **Reluctant variants**: Slower animation, more mystical/deliberate
- **Legendary variants**: Dramatic, ceremonial breeding sequence

**Collection Display (How Character Presents)**

**Gallery Pose:**
- **Show-offs**: Front and center, dynamic pose (Epics, flashy personalities)
- **Humble**: Relaxed pose, less dramatic (Commons, gentle personalities)
- **Mysterious**: Partially obscured, ethereal (COSMIC, enigmatic personalities)

**Example - "Neon Serpent" Behaviors:**

**Idle**: Constantly moving head, looking around curiously, neon pulses like excited heartbeat
**Meaning**: Energetic, attention-seeking, playful

**Breeding**: Quick to respond, bright particle burst, eager animation
**Meaning**: Enthusiastic participant

**Collection**: Dynamic S-curve pose, front-facing, showing off glow effects
**Meaning**: Wants attention, proud to be displayed

---

## Step 6: Test Character Effectiveness

**Validate that design actually communicates intended personality.**

**Character Effectiveness Tests:**

**Test 1: First Impression (5-Second Test)**
- Show variant for 5 seconds
- Ask: "Describe this character in 3 words"
- **Success**: 2+ words match your intended personality adjectives

**Test 2: Dynasty Recognition**
- Show variant without context
- Ask: "Which dynasty is this from?"
- **Success**: 95%+ correct identification

**Test 3: Silhouette Recognition**
- Show only silhouette
- Ask: "Can you identify this variant?"
- **Success**: Distinctive enough to recognize from shape alone (especially Rares+)

**Test 4: Emotional Response**
- Show variant, ask: "How does this make you feel?"
- **Success**: Responses match intended emotional function

**Test 5: Rarity Perception**
- Show variant, ask: "What rarity do you think this is?"
- **Success**: Perceived rarity matches actual rarity (±1 tier)

**Test 6: Character Backstory Projection**
- Show variant, ask: "What's this snake's story?"
- **Success**: Player-created stories align with your implied backstory themes

**Example Test Results - "Serpent King":**

```
Test 1 - First Impression:
Player responses: "Powerful, ancient, regal" ✓ (matches intended)

Test 2 - Dynasty:
95% correctly identified as PRIMAL ✓

Test 3 - Silhouette:
Recognized by crown/horns alone ✓

Test 4 - Emotional Response:
"Impressed," "awed," "want to earn this" ✓ (legendary-appropriate)

Test 5 - Rarity:
100% identified as Legendary (obvious from design) ✓

Test 6 - Backstory:
Stories involved: ancient ruler, survived ages, protects realm ✓ (matches implied backstory)
```

**Fixing Failed Tests:**

**Problem**: Players can't identify dynasty
**Fix**: Stronger dynasty visual elements (colors, patterns, materials)

**Problem**: Personality unclear
**Fix**: Exaggerate personality features (expression, pose, details)

**Problem**: Rarity perceived wrong (Epic looks Common)
**Fix**: Add complexity and polish to match intended rarity

**Problem**: Character forgettable
**Fix**: Stronger visual hook, more distinctive silhouette

## Tips for Success

✅ **DO:**
- Start with personality, then design visuals to match
- Exaggerate distinctive features (subtle doesn't read)
- Test early with target players (fresh eyes catch issues)
- Make silhouette distinctive (recognizable from shadow)
- Ensure rarity matches visual complexity
- Design for both Emma and Tyler when possible

❌ **DON'T:**
- Design "pretty snake" without personality (generic = forgettable)
- Over-complicate commons (should be approachable)
- Under-deliver on legendaries (must justify pursuit)
- Mix dynasty aesthetics unintentionally (breaks coherence)
- Forget functional requirements (must work in gameplay)
- Skip testing (assumptions are often wrong)

---

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: No Clear Personality**
- **Problem**: Variant is just "a snake" with no character
- **Fix**: Define 3-5 personality adjectives first, then design

**Mistake 2: Personality-Design Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Intended as "mysterious" but looks "aggressive"
- **Fix**: Test with users, adjust visuals to match personality

**Mistake 3: Rarity Inflation**
- **Problem**: Commons look like Legendaries (or vice versa)
- **Fix**: Match visual complexity to rarity tier

**Mistake 4: Dynasty Confusion**
- **Problem**: Can't tell which dynasty variant belongs to
- **Fix**: Stronger dynasty visual elements (colors, patterns, materials)

**Mistake 5: Forgettable Design**
- **Problem**: Variant doesn't stand out, players forget it
- **Fix**: Stronger visual hook, more exaggerated features
