# How to Design Dynasty Worlds

**Goal**: Create cohesive, distinctive thematic worlds for each dynasty that players want to explore and collect.

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks per dynasty (visual development, testing, refinement)

**Prerequisites**:
- Understanding of @knowledge_base/game/quick_ref/dynasties.md
- Visual design tools (Midjourney, Photoshop, etc.)
- Knowledge of @knowledge_base/game_design/quick_ref/concept_world_building.md

## Step 1: Define Dynasty Identity

**Establish Core Theme**

Each dynasty is a self-contained thematic world with clear identity.

**Dynasty Identity Template:**

```
DYNASTY: [Name]
CORE THEME: [1-2 word essence]
WORLD CONCEPT: [Brief description of this realm]

ADJECTIVES (5-7):
- [Feeling 1] (e.g., "futuristic")
- [Feeling 2] (e.g., "sleek")
- [Feeling 3] (e.g., "energetic")
- [Feeling 4]
- [Feeling 5]

VISUAL INSPIRATIONS:
- [Reference 1] (e.g., "Tron: Legacy")
- [Reference 2] (e.g., "Cyberpunk 2077")
- [Reference 3] (e.g., "Circuit board macro photography")

AUDIO INSPIRATIONS:
- [Reference 1] (e.g., "Daft Punk - Tron soundtrack")

OPPOSED TO:
- [Anti-theme 1] (e.g., "natural/organic")
- [Anti-theme 2] (e.g., "ancient/weathered")
```

## Step 2: Develop Visual Language

**Create Dynasty Color Palettes**

Colors are the fastest way to communicate dynasty identity.

**Color Psychology:**
- **CYBER**: Electric blues, neon cyans, bright magentas, digital greens (energetic, modern)
- **PRIMAL**: Earthy browns, forest greens, stone grays, blood reds (grounded, powerful)
- **COSMIC**: Deep purples, midnight blues, stellar whites, nebula pinks (mysterious, vast)

**Color Rules:**

**Primary Palette (3-4 colors):**
- Used for main variant designs
- Defines dynasty at a glance
- Should be immediately recognizable

**Secondary Palette (3-5 colors):**
- Accent colors for variety
- Used in higher-rarity variants
- Supports primary palette

**Forbidden Colors:**
- Colors that strongly evoke other dynasties
- Example: Don't use neon cyan in PRIMAL (feels CYBER)

**CYBER Color Example:**
```
PRIMARY PALETTE:
- Electric Blue (#00D4FF) - main identity color
- Neon Cyan (#00FFFF) - accent/glow
- Digital Magenta (#FF00FF) - contrast/energy
- Circuit Green (#00FF00) - detail/data

SECONDARY PALETTE:
- Deep Navy (#001133) - shadows/depth
- White (#FFFFFF) - highlights
- Silver (#C0C0C0) - metallic accents

FORBIDDEN:
- Earthy browns (too PRIMAL)
- Organic greens (too PRIMAL)
- Deep space purples (too COSMIC)
```

**Develop Pattern Library**

Patterns reinforce dynasty identity through repetition.

**CYBER Patterns:**
- Circuit board traces
- Geometric grids (hexagons, triangles)
- Binary code textures
- Scan lines and digital artifacts
- Pixel/voxel elements
- Holographic distortions

**PRIMAL Patterns:**
- Tribal stripes and symbols
- Scale textures (reptilian)
- Weathered stone carvings
- Organic vein-like lines
- Natural fractals (branches, roots)
- Handcrafted/imperfect edges

**COSMIC Patterns:**
- Star clusters and constellations
- Nebula swirls and flows
- Sacred geometry (Fibonacci, golden ratio)
- Energy/aura radiations
- Cosmic dust and particle fields
- Ethereal gradients

**Create Material and Texture Guidelines**

Materials communicate physical properties of the world.

**CYBER Materials:**
- Glossy plastics (smooth, reflective)
- Glowing elements (LEDs, neon)
- Transparent holographic layers
- Metallic chrome/aluminum
- Digital screen displays

**PRIMAL Materials:**
- Rough stone (weathered, textured)
- Organic leather/hide
- Carved wood
- Natural bone/horn
- Earth and clay

**COSMIC Materials:**
- Ethereal energy (semi-transparent)
- Stellar light (glowing, soft)
- Crystalline formations
- Nebula gas (flowing, misty)
- Celestial metals (iridescent)

## Step 3: Design Environmental Contexts

**Lab Backgrounds as World Windows**

Each lab (Evolution, Breeding, Collection) shows glimpse of dynasty world.

**Background Design Process:**

**A. Sketch Concepts (3-5 per dynasty)**

For CYBER Evolution Lab, explore:
1. Digital grid stretching to infinity
2. Inside a massive server room
3. Floating in data stream
4. Holographic testing chamber
5. Virtual reality construct

**B. Test Readability**

Place snake silhouette on background:
- Can you see the snake clearly? (avoid visual noise)
- Does background enhance or distract? (support gameplay)
- Does it feel like the dynasty world? (coherence check)

**C. Refine for Function**

Backgrounds must support gameplay (see @knowledge_base/game_design/quick_ref/lens_95_functional_space.md):

**Functional Requirements:**
- Don't obscure snake (keep busy areas away from center)
- Support dynasty mood (CYBER = energetic, PRIMAL = powerful, COSMIC = serene)
- Clear visual hierarchy (background recedes, snake pops forward)
- Appropriate detail density (rich enough to feel like world, simple enough to not distract)

**Example - CYBER Evolution Lab Background:**

```
CONCEPT: Infinite digital grid with data streams

COMPOSITION:
- Background: Deep navy (#001133) fading to black at edges
- Midground: Electric blue grid lines (#00D4FF, 50% opacity)
- Detail: Occasional data streams flowing across grid
- Accent: Subtle circuit traces in corners
- Edge glow: Cyan (#00FFFF) vignette around play area

FUNCTIONAL CHECKS:
✓ Snake clearly visible (dark background, snake uses bright colors)
✓ Feels CYBER (grid + data = technology)
✓ Not distracting (grid is subtle, data streams slow)
✓ Supports mood (clean, modern, futuristic)
```

**D. Create Variations Per Lab**

Each lab has different purpose, background should support it:

**Evolution Lab**: Active, energetic (gameplay happens here)
- More dynamic elements (flowing data, moving patterns)
- Higher contrast (energetic mood)

**Breeding Lab**: Curious, experimental (discovery happens here)
- Balanced detail (not too busy, not too empty)
- Suggests creation/combination

**Collection Lab**: Proud, accomplished (trophy display)
- Gallery-like presentation
- Elegant, showcase quality
- Celebratory mood

## Step 4: Establish Design Rules

**Create Dynasty Style Guide**

Document rules so all future variants/content stay coherent.

**Style Guide Template:**

```
[DYNASTY NAME] STYLE GUIDE

CORE IDENTITY:
[One-sentence essence]

MUST HAVE:
- [Required element 1]
- [Required element 2]
- [Required element 3]

MUST NOT HAVE:
- [Forbidden element 1]
- [Forbidden element 2]

COLOR RULES:
Primary: [colors]
Accent: [colors]
Forbidden: [colors]

PATTERN RULES:
Encouraged: [patterns]
Forbidden: [patterns]

MATERIAL RULES:
Use: [materials]
Avoid: [materials]

ANIMATION RULES:
Motion style: [description]
Effects: [allowed effects]
Forbidden: [effects that break coherence]

EXAMPLES:
[Show 3-5 reference images that perfectly capture dynasty]
```

**CYBER Dynasty Style Guide Example:**

```
CYBER DYNASTY STYLE GUIDE

Avoid: Acoustic instruments, natural ambient, organic sounds

COHERENCE TEST:
"If I showed this to someone who knows Tron and cyberpunk, would they immediately say 'that's digital/tech themed'?"
```

---

## Step 5: Design Variant Progression

**Rarity Tiers Express World Depth**

As players progress through rarities, they go deeper into dynasty world.

**Rarity as World Exploration:**

**Commons (Starting World):**
- **Purpose**: Introduce dynasty basics
- **Design**: Clear, simple expressions of core identity
- **World Position**: "Everyday citizens" of this realm
- **Example**: Basic CYBER snake with simple circuit pattern

**Uncommons (Going Deeper):**
- **Purpose**: Show personality variety within dynasty
- **Design**: More distinctive, explore sub-themes
- **World Position**: "Interesting locals" with unique roles
- **Example**: CYBER snake with specific tech specialty (network, security, data)

**Rares (Core Identity):**
- **Purpose**: Definitive dynasty expressions
- **Design**: Strong personality, memorable, what people think of when they hear dynasty name
- **World Position**: "Notable figures" in dynasty hierarchy
- **Example**: CYBER snake that exemplifies cutting-edge technology

**Epics (Dynasty Mastery):**
- **Purpose**: Peak dynasty achievements
- **Design**: Complex, multi-layered, pushes dynasty aesthetic to limits
- **World Position**: "Elite members" or "champions" of realm
- **Example**: CYBER snake with advanced holographic effects, multiple tech systems

**Legendaries (Dynasty Embodiment):**
- **Purpose**: Ultimate dynasty representation, what dynasty aspires to
- **Design**: Iconic, god-tier, represents best of dynasty philosophy
- **World Position**: "Ruler" or "ultimate expression" of world
- **Example**: CYBER dynasty leader - pure digital consciousness, transcendent technology

**Design Progression Example - CYBER Dynasty:**

```
COMMON: "Circuit Runner"
- Simple blue snake with basic circuit pattern
- Clean design, immediately readable as CYBER
- "First glimpse into digital realm"

UNCOMMON: "Data Weaver"
- Cyan snake with flowing data streams in pattern
- More personality, specific tech niche (data)
- "Meeting interesting locals in CYBER world"

RARE: "Neon Serpent"
- Multi-color neon (blue/magenta/cyan)
- Pulsing glow effects, dynamic circuit patterns
- "Peak of CYBER aesthetic - what people imagine when they think CYBER"

EPIC: "Holo-Viper"
- Transparent holographic body with multiple layered effects
- Complex circuit systems, particle trails
- "Elite CYBER technology - pushing boundaries"

LEGENDARY: "Digital Ascendant"
- Pure light construct, transcendent digital being
- God-tier presence, ultimate CYBER evolution
- "The ideal CYBER entity - what all CYBER snakes aspire to become"
```

This progression takes player on journey from "entering CYBER world" (commons) to "mastering CYBER realm" (legendary).

## Step 6: Test World Coherence

**The Coherence Audit**

Before launching dynasty, test if world holds together.

**Visual Coherence Test:**

1. **Random Variant Test**
   - Display variant without context
   - Ask: "Which dynasty is this from?"
   - Target: 95%+ accuracy from target players

2. **Dynasty Mix Test**
   - Show 10 variants: 5 from target dynasty, 5 from others
   - Ask: "Which 5 belong together?"
   - Target: Perfect identification

3. **Background Test**
   - Show lab background alone
   - Ask: "What kind of world is this?"
   - Target: Answers match dynasty adjectives

4. **Coherence Break Test**
   - Deliberately mix dynasty elements (CYBER snake on PRIMAL background)
   - Ask: "Does this feel right or wrong?"
   - Target: Players immediately notice mismatch

**Thematic Coherence Test:**

1. **Adjective Matching**
   - Show variant, ask for 3-5 adjectives
   - Target: 60%+ of words match dynasty identity document

2. **Music Pairing**
   - Play dynasty music, show variant
   - Ask: "Do these match?"
   - Target: Confident "yes"

3. **Story Prompt**
   - Show variant, ask "What's this snake's backstory?"
   - Target: Stories reflect dynasty theme (CYBER = tech origin, PRIMAL = ancient tale, etc.)

**Gameplay Coherence Test:**

1. **Breeding Logic**
   - CYBER × CYBER = clearly CYBER child
   - CYBER × PRIMAL = clearly hybrid child (not muddy mix)
   - Target: Players understand inheritance at glance

2. **Progression Feel**
   - Common → Legendary feels like going deeper into dynasty
   - Target: Players describe progression as "exploring CYBER world more"

**Fixing Coherence Breaks:**

**Problem**: Players confuse dynasties
- **Solution**: Increase visual differentiation, stronger color separation, clearer patterns

**Problem**: Variants don't feel like they belong together
- **Solution**: Audit style guide compliance, ensure all variants follow rules

**Problem**: World feels generic
- **Solution**: Amplify distinctive elements, remove neutral/generic details

**Problem**: Rarity progression doesn't show world depth
- **Solution**: Redesign legendaries to be ultimate dynasty expressions

---

## Step 7: Document and Expand

**Create Dynasty Bible**

For future content and potential transmedia expansion.

**Dynasty Bible Contents:**

```
[DYNASTY NAME] BIBLE

1. CORE IDENTITY
   - Essence statement
   - Adjectives
   - Philosophy

2. VISUAL LANGUAGE
   - Color palette (hex codes)
   - Pattern library (with examples)
   - Material guidelines
   - Do's and Don'ts

3. WORLD LORE
   - Origin story (how did this dynasty emerge?)
   - World physics (how does this realm work?)
   - Cultural values (what does this dynasty value?)
   - Mythology (legends of this world)

4. VARIANT CATALOG
   - All current variants with descriptions
   - Rarity progression logic
   - Personality archetypes

5. AUDIO IDENTITY
   - Music genre/style
   - Sound effect guidelines
   - Reference tracks

6. EXPANSION HOOKS
   - Potential new variants
   - Sub-themes to explore
   - Transmedia possibilities

7. COHERENCE CHECKLIST
   - Tests to run for new content
   - Required elements
   - Forbidden elements
```

**Plan Monthly Expansions**

Each month, add 3-5 new variants to keep dynasty fresh (see @knowledge_base/game/how_to/add_new_dynasty.md).

**Expansion Strategy:**
- Explore sub-themes within dynasty (CYBER: AI, networks, security, virtual reality)
- Maintain coherence while adding variety
- Test new variants against style guide before finalizing

---

## Tips for Success

✅ **DO:**
- Start with crystal-clear dynasty identity (if you can't explain it in 5 words, it's not clear enough)
- Create comprehensive style guide BEFORE designing variants
- Test coherence early and often (show to fresh eyes)
- Be ruthless about cutting elements that don't fit
- Document everything for future designers

❌ **DON'T:**
- Mix dynasty aesthetics unintentionally (every element should clearly belong to one dynasty)
- Add "cool ideas" that break coherence (cool but wrong is still wrong)
- Assume players will "get it" without testing (always validate)
- Forget functional requirements (pretty but unusable is failure)
- Let style drift over time (enforce style guide consistency)

---

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Generic Worlds**
- **Problem**: Dynasties feel interchangeable, not distinctive
- **Fix**: Amplify unique elements, remove generic/neutral details, stronger color separation

**Mistake 2: Coherence Drift**
- **Problem**: Later variants don't match early variants in style
- **Fix**: Enforce style guide strictly, audit all content against dynasty bible

**Mistake 3: Function Forgotten**
- **Problem**: Beautiful designs that don't support gameplay
- **Fix**: Test functional space requirements, prioritize playability over decoration

**Mistake 4: Overcomplicated Identity**
- **Problem**: Dynasty has too many themes, confusing
- **Fix**: Simplify to ONE core theme, eliminate conflicting elements

**Mistake 5: Weak Differentiation**
- **Problem**: Dynasties too similar to each other
- **Fix**: Increase contrast (if CYBER is geometric, PRIMAL should be organic; if CYBER is bright, COSMIC should be deep/mysterious)

## Example: Designing COSMIC Dynasty (Full Process)

**Step 1: Identity**
```
CORE THEME: Space Mystery
ADJECTIVES: Mysterious, ethereal, vast, transcendent, flowing
OPPOSED TO: Grounded, mundane, sharp, dense
```

**Step 2: Visual Language**
```
COLORS: Deep purples, midnight blues, stellar whites, nebula pinks
PATTERNS: Star clusters, nebula swirls, sacred geometry
MATERIALS: Ethereal energy, stellar light, crystalline
```

**Step 3: Environment**
```
Evolution Lab Background: Floating in deep space, distant galaxies, nebula in background
FUNCTIONAL CHECKS: Dark background (snake pops), serene (not distracting), mysterious mood ✓
```

**Step 4: Style Guide**
```
MUST HAVE: Flowing forms, ethereal glow, space/mystical elements
MUST NOT: Sharp/rigid, grounded/solid, mundane/ordinary
```

**Step 5: Variant Progression**
```
COMMON: "Starlight Serpent" - simple constellation pattern
RARE: "Nebula Dancer" - flowing nebula effects in body
LEGENDARY: "Cosmic Oracle" - transcendent being of pure celestial energy
```

**Step 6: Test**
```
Visual Test: Show variants → 98% correctly identify as COSMIC ✓
Thematic Test: Player descriptions use words like "space," "mysterious," "ethereal" ✓
```

**Step 7: Document**
```
COSMIC Dynasty Bible created with style guide, lore, expansion hooks ✓
```

**Result**: Cohesive, distinctive dynasty that players instantly recognize and want to explore.
