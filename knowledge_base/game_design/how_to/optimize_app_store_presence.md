# How to Optimize App Store Presence (ASO for Indie Mobile)

**Goal**: Maximize organic downloads through App Store Optimization (ASO)‚Äîthe mobile equivalent of SEO.

**Timeline**: 3-5 days initial setup, ongoing iteration (weekly screenshots tests, monthly keyword updates)

**Prerequisites**: Game built and ready for screenshots, clear understanding of target audience, competitor research completed

---

## Overview

Your indie mobile game is invisible until discovered. With 1.8M iOS apps and 2.5M Android apps, organic discoverability determines success or failure.

App Store Optimization (ASO) makes your game findable in search (65% of downloads), attractive in browse (25%), and compelling enough to convert views to downloads (30%+ conversion rate).

This guide walks through SupaSnake's ASO strategy as a template for solo indie devs with $0 marketing budget.

## Step 1: Research Your Keywords

Before writing anything, understand what users search for and where you can rank.

### Keyword Research Process

**Tool**: App Annie (free tier) or Sensor Tower (7-day trial)

**Process**:
1. Search your genre: "snake game"
2. Note top 10 results: What keywords appear in titles?
3. Check competitor keywords: Click top apps ‚Üí See their keyword rankings
4. Build keyword list: Mix of high-volume (competitive) + low-volume (winnable)

**SupaSnake Keyword Research**:

**Primary keywords** (high search volume, high competition):
- "snake game" (100k+ searches/month, but #1 is original Snake)
- "casual game" (80k+/month)
- "arcade game" (60k+/month)

**Verdict**: Too competitive for indie (can't beat established brands), but include for secondary ranking

**Secondary keywords** (medium volume, moderate competition):
- "breeding game" (20k+/month)
- "collection game" (15k+/month)
- "snake collect" (5k+/month)

**Verdict**: Winnable (fewer apps, SupaSnake unique angle), target these

**Long-tail keywords** (low volume, low competition, HIGH conversion):
- "snake breeding collect" (1k+/month, almost no competition)
- "pokemon like snake" (500/month, very specific intent)
- "casual snake arcade" (300/month)

**Verdict**: Easiest to rank, searchers know exactly what they want ‚Üí High conversion

**Keyword list** (final):
1. snake game (primary)
2. breeding game
3. collection game
4. casual game
5. snake breeding
6. evolve snakes
7. snake variants
8. dynasty game
9. genetics game
10. arcade collection

**Length limit**: iOS 100 characters, Android 80 characters ‚Üí Prioritize ruthlessly

### Competitor Analysis

**Top 3 "snake game" competitors**:
1. **Snake.io** (50M+ downloads)
   - Title: "snake.io - Fun Snake .io Games"
   - Keywords: snake, io, multiplayer, casual
   - Weakness: No single-player focus, no breeding/collection

2. **Slither.io** (100M+ downloads)
   - Title: "slither.io"
   - Keywords: slither, snake, io, online
   - Weakness: Online-only, no progression meta

3. **Snake '97** (10M+ downloads)
   - Title: "Snake '97: Retro Phone Classic"
   - Keywords: retro, classic, 90s, snake
   - Weakness: No modern features, pure nostalgia

**SupaSnake differentiation**:
- Not multiplayer (different audience)
- Breeding/collection meta (unique in snake category)
- Modern + nostalgic (best of both)

**Opportunity**: Rank for "breeding game" and "collection game" where Snake competitors don't rank

---

## Step 2: Craft Your App Name + Subtitle

Your app name is the MOST important ASO element (highest keyword weight).

### App Name Formula

**Structure**: [Brand Name] - [Benefit Keywords]

**SupaSnake options**:

**Option 1**: "SupaSnake - Snake Breeding Game"
- ‚úÖ Includes "snake" and "breeding" (top 2 keywords)
- ‚úÖ Clear value prop
- ‚ùå Generic "game" (wasted characters)

**Option 2**: "SupaSnake: Breed & Collect Snakes"
- ‚úÖ Action verbs (breed, collect) = player benefit
- ‚úÖ Plural "snakes" (variety implication)
- ‚ùå Doesn't include "game" keyword

**Option 3**: "SupaSnake - Collect Rare Snakes"
- ‚úÖ "Rare" = collector appeal
- ‚úÖ Short (room for subtitle)
- ‚ùå Doesn't mention breeding (key differentiator)

**Final choice**: "SupaSnake - Breed & Collect Snakes"
- Reasoning: "Breed" is unique angle, "collect" explains meta, action verbs convert better

**Character count**: 36/30 characters (iOS limit) ‚Üí Trim to "SupaSnake: Breed & Collect" (28 chars)

### Subtitle (iOS) / Short Description (Android)

**iOS subtitle** (30 characters):
- "Classic Snake, Now Evolve Them"
- Reasoning: Communicates nostalgia + innovation in 30 chars

**Android short description** (80 characters):
- "Remember Snake? Now breed, collect, and evolve them. Discover rare variants!"
- Reasoning: Hook (nostalgia) ‚Üí Unique mechanic (breed) ‚Üí Goal (discover)

---

## Step 3: Design Killer Screenshots

Screenshots drive conversion. Users spend 5-10 seconds here ‚Üí Make them count.

### Screenshot Strategy

**Layout** (iOS/Android portrait):
- First 2 screenshots visible without scrolling (CRITICAL)
- Users scroll for 3rd-5th IF interested
- 6-10th rarely seen

**SupaSnake screenshot strategy** (5 screenshots total):

**Screenshot 1: Instant Recognition**

**Content**:
- Classic Snake gameplay (full screen)
- Snake clearly visible (bright colors, readable at thumbnail)
- Food items, score UI visible

**Text overlay** (top third, large font):
- "Classic Snake, Reimagined"

**Purpose**: Genre signal (users know this game type)

**Design notes**:
- High-contrast (snake vs. background)
- Clean UI (not cluttered)
- Mid-game (action, not start screen)

**Screenshot 2: Unique Value Prop**

**Content**:
- Breeding Lab UI (two parent snakes + egg in center)
- Genetics visual (DNA strands, color mixing)
- "Breed" button prominent

**Text overlay**:
- "Breed Snakes to Unlock Rare Variants"

**Purpose**: Differentiation (not just Snake, has meta-game)

**Design notes**:
- Parents visually distinct (different colors/patterns)
- Egg mysterious (what will it be?)
- Implies strategy (which parents to combine?)

**Screenshot 3: Collection Hook**

**Content**:
- Collection Lab showing dynasty (5/15 variants unlocked)
- Locked silhouettes (implies more to discover)
- Progress bar (60% complete)

**Text overlay**:
- "Complete 3 Dynasties, Collect 45 Snakes"

**Purpose**: "Gotta catch 'em all" psychology (collector appeal)

**Design notes**:
- Mix of unlocked (colorful) + locked (silhouettes) ‚Üí Shows progress potential
- Large numbers (45 snakes) ‚Üí Content depth
- Dynasty theming visible (Ouroboros, Basilisk, Hydra distinct)

**Screenshot 4: Progression Tease**

**Content**:
- Rare legendary variant (Gen 4, glowing effects)
- Compare to basic Gen 1 (before/after)
- Evolution tree visual

**Text overlay**:
- "Evolve from Common to Legendary"

**Purpose**: Aspirational goal (carrot on stick)

**Design notes**:
- Legendary looks COOL (player wants this)
- Before/after shows tangible progression
- Implies depth (not just collect, but evolve)

**Screenshot 5: Social Proof (Optional)**

**Content**:
- Leaderboard (if real data available)
- OR: Testimonials from beta testers
- OR: Press quote (if coverage)

**Text overlay**:
- "Compete on Global Leaderboards"
- OR: "Join 10,000 Snake Breeders"

**Purpose**: Social proof (others play, you should too)

**Design notes**:
- Real data only (no fake numbers)
- If no data, skip this screenshot

### Screenshot Design Tools

**Options**:
- **Figma** (free, templates available)
- **Canva** (free tier, screenshot templates)
- **DaVinci Resolve** (free, for video preview)

**Process**:
1. Capture raw gameplay (iPhone screen recording, 1170x2532 resolution)
2. Import to Figma
3. Add text overlays (title + 1 sentence benefit)
4. Export PNG (2x resolution for Retina)
5. Upload to App Store Connect

**Time estimate**: 4-6 hours (capture gameplay, design in Figma, export)

---

## Step 4: Write Compelling Description

The first 3 lines are visible without "Read More" ‚Üí These must hook.

### Description Formula

**Line 1**: Nostalgia hook (familiar + intrigue)
**Line 2**: Unique mechanic (differentiation)
**Line 3**: Goal/reward (why play)

**SupaSnake description**:

```
[Lines 1-3: The Hook - Visible without "Read More"]

```

**Word count**: ~200 words (sweet spot for App Store)

**Keyword density**: Natural (not spammy), includes all 10 target keywords organically

### Description Don'ts

‚ùå **Don't keyword stuff**: "Snake game snake breeding snake collect snake arcade snake..." (flagged as spam)
‚ùå **Don't use ALL CAPS**: "DOWNLOAD NOW!!!" (looks desperate)
‚ùå **Don't promise false features**: "100 levels!" (if you have 10)
‚ùå **Don't bury the hook**: Put boring stuff first (users won't read more)

---

## Step 5: Create App Preview Video (Optional, High Impact)

Videos auto-play in App Store (15-30 seconds) ‚Üí Huge conversion boost.

### Video Script (30 seconds)

**0-5s**: Classic Snake gameplay
- User swipes, snake moves, eats food, grows
- Text: "You know Snake..."

**5-10s**: Snake reaches goal, egg appears
- Celebration animation
- Text: "...now breed them"

**10-15s**: Breeding Lab, two snakes combined
- Parents shown, egg hatches, new variant revealed
- Text: "Unlock rare variants"

**15-20s**: Collection Lab montage
- 5-8 different snake variants flash by
- Dynasty progress bar fills
- Text: "Collect 45 snakes"

**20-25s**: Rare legendary snake (glowing, cool)
- Evolution from Gen 1 ‚Üí Gen 4
- Text: "Evolve to legendary"

**25-30s**: Logo + CTA
- SupaSnake logo
- Text: "Download Free Today"

**Production**:
- Capture: Screen recording on iPhone/Android (1080p)
- Edit: iMovie (free, Mac) or DaVinci Resolve (free, PC)
- Text: Simple subtitles (large, readable)
- Music: Upbeat 8-bit (royalty-free from YouTube Audio Library)

**Time estimate**: 6-8 hours (capture, edit, export)

**ROI**: Video increases conversion 20-30% (worth the time)

---

## Step 6: Optimize Icon

Your icon appears in search results at 60x60pt (tiny) ‚Üí Must be recognizable.

### Icon Design Principles

**SupaSnake icon requirements**:
1. **Instant recognition**: Snake shape clear at 60x60pt
2. **Distinct from competitors**: Not generic green snake
3. **Pops on white/dark backgrounds**: Works in light/dark mode
4. **Simple**: No text, no clutter (illegible when small)

**Design approach**:
- **Shape**: Snake head (not full body) ‚Üí Iconic, memorable
- **Pattern**: Gradient scales (hints at genetic diversity)
- **Color**: Vibrant purple/blue (NOT green like every other snake game)
- **Background**: Solid color (not transparent, not gradient)

**Testing**:
- Place next to Candy Crush, Subway Surfers, Fruit Ninja icons
- At 60x60pt, does SupaSnake stand out? (yes = good, no = redesign)

**Tools**: Figma (vector), export at 1024x1024 (App Store requirement)

**Time estimate**: 2-4 hours (design + iterations)

---

## Step 7: Manage Ratings & Reviews

4.5+ stars = credible, <4.0 stars = red flag (users skip)

### Review Generation Strategy

**When to prompt**:
- ‚ùå Day 1 (user hasn't experienced enough, likely to skip)
- ‚ùå After dying (negative moment, risk 1-star)
- ‚úÖ After first successful breed (positive achievement, emotional high)
- ‚úÖ Day 7+ (retained players, not drive-bys)

**How to prompt**:
- Use iOS `SKStoreReviewController` (native, non-intrusive)
- Limit: Max 3 prompts per year (Apple policy)
- Respect user choice (if they dismiss, don't ask again soon)

**What NOT to do**:
- ‚ùå Incentivize reviews (Apple prohibits, will reject app)
- ‚ùå Gate features behind reviews ("Rate to unlock!")
- ‚ùå Ask for 5 stars specifically (biases ratings, against guidelines)

### Review Response Strategy

**Respond to ALL reviews** (good AND bad):

**Positive review response**:
- "Thanks for playing SupaSnake! We're so glad you're enjoying breeding snakes. Stay tuned for new dynasties coming soon! üêç"

**Negative review response**:
- Acknowledge issue
- State fix (if possible)
- Ask for details (if vague)

**Example**:
- Review: "Game crashes when breeding" (1 star)
- Response: "Sorry to hear that! We've identified the crash bug and it's fixed in version 1.2 (submitted to Apple, should be live in 2 days). Please update and let us know if it still happens. Contact: support@supasnake.com"

**Impact**:
- Shows developer cares (builds loyalty)
- Turns some 1-stars into 4-stars (users update review after fix)
- Provides feedback for next update

**Time commitment**: 10 min/day (check reviews, respond)

---

## Step 8: A/B Test and Iterate

ASO is not set-and-forget. Test variations, measure impact, iterate monthly.

### What to Test

**Screenshots** (biggest impact):
- Test A: Gameplay first, breeding second
- Test B: Breeding first, gameplay second
- Measure: Conversion rate (views ‚Üí downloads)

**App name variations** (careful, can confuse brand):
- Current: "SupaSnake: Breed & Collect"
- Test: "SupaSnake - Genetics & Arcade"
- Measure: Keyword rankings (does "genetics" rank better?)

**Icon variations**:
- Test A: Purple snake head
- Test B: Blue snake head
- Measure: Click-through rate (impressions ‚Üí views)

**Description hooks**:
- Test A: "Remember Snake from your old phone?"
- Test B: "Classic Snake meets Pok√©mon breeding"
- Measure: Conversion rate

### How to A/B Test

**iOS**: App Store Connect "Product Page Optimization" (built-in A/B testing)
- Create 3 variations (screenshots, icon)
- Split traffic 25/25/25/25 (3 tests + control)
- Run for 2-4 weeks (statistical significance)
- Measure: Conversion rate, downloads

**Android**: Google Play Console "Store Listing Experiments"
- Similar to iOS, but separate setup
- Test screenshots, icon, short description

**Iteration cadence**:
- Week 1-2: Launch with best guess
- Week 3-6: A/B test screenshots (biggest impact)
- Month 2: Test icon variations
- Month 3+: Test description/keywords (lower impact)

**Red flag**: Changing too often confuses users (pick best, stick with it for 1-2 months)

---

## Step 9: Localization (Future Expansion)

**Phase 1 (MVP)**: English only (US, UK, Canada, Australia, India)

**Phase 2 (Growth)**: Add Spanish + French (largest non-English markets)
- Localize: App name, description, screenshots (text overlays)
- Don't localize: Gameplay (universal visual language)

**Impact**: 2-3x downloads in localized markets (worth the effort)

**Cost**: ~$50-100 per language (description translation), 2-4 hours (screenshot text overlays)

**Priority**: After hitting 10k downloads in English (validate product-market fit first)

---

## Metrics to Track

### ASO Performance

**Keyword rankings** (App Annie, Sensor Tower):
- "snake breeding" ‚Üí Target: Top 10
- "collection game" ‚Üí Target: Top 20
- "snake game" ‚Üí Target: Top 100 (highly competitive)

**Conversion funnel**:
- Impressions: 10,000 (how many saw your listing)
- Product page views: 3,000 (30% CTR, good icon)
- Downloads: 1,000 (33% conversion, good screenshots)

**Benchmarks**:
- CTR (impressions ‚Üí views): 25-40% (good icon)
- Conversion (views ‚Üí downloads): 30-50% (good screenshots + description)

**Red flags**:
- ‚ùå High impressions, low views (bad icon, fix first)
- ‚ùå High views, low downloads (bad screenshots/description, fix second)

### Discovery Sources

**App Store Connect analytics**:
- Search: 65% of downloads (keyword optimization working)
- Browse: 25% (category rankings)
- Featured: 10% (if lucky, not reliable)

**Goal**: Maximize search (your controllable lever)

## Common ASO Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Keyword Stuffing in Name

**Bad**: "SupaSnake - Snake Breeding Collect Evolve Game Casual Arcade Fun"
- Looks spammy, users distrust, Apple may reject

**Good**: "SupaSnake: Breed & Collect Snakes"
- Clean, benefit-focused, natural

### Mistake 2: Screenshot Walls of Text

**Bad**: Paragraph of text explaining mechanics on screenshot
- Unreadable at thumbnail size, intimidating

**Good**: 4-6 words max, large font, key benefit

### Mistake 3: Generic Screenshots

**Bad**: Just menu screens, no gameplay
- Doesn't show what game IS

**Good**: Action shots, gameplay clearly visible

### Mistake 4: Never Updating ASO

**Bad**: Launch with first-guess ASO, never change
- Miss opportunities, competitors out-ASO you

**Good**: Monthly keyword check, quarterly screenshot tests
