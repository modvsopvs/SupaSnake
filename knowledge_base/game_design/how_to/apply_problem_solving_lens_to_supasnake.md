# How to Apply Problem Solving Lens to SupaSnake

**Schell's Principle:** "A game is a problem-solving activity, approached with a playful attitude." Every game presents problems for players to solve—the key is identifying what problems your game asks players to solve, ensuring those problems are interesting, and generating new problems to sustain engagement.

**SupaSnake Context:** Mobile collection game where breeding mechanics must present meaningful problems without creating frustrating barriers in 30-90 second sessions.

## Overview

The Problem Solving Lens (Lens #6) helps designers view games through the player's problem-solving mindset. For SupaSnake, this means analyzing every system—breeding, collection, energy, Classic Mode—as a problem space where players exercise curiosity, make choices, and feel satisfaction upon solving.

**The Three Questions:**
1. What problems does my game ask the player to solve?
2. Are there hidden problems that arise during gameplay?
3. How can my game generate new problems so players keep coming back?

---

## Step 1: Identify Core Problems

**Explicit Problems (What you ask players to solve):**

**Breeding Lab:**
- "Which dynasties should I cross to create this target variant?"
- "How do I efficiently use my limited DNA to reach collection goals?"
- "What generation depth do I need to unlock rare variants?"

**Collection Lab:**
- "Which dynasty should I complete first?"
- "How do I balance common variants (easy) vs. rare variants (satisfying)?"
- "Should I focus on one dynasty or diversify?"

**Classic Mode:**
- "Can I beat my previous high score?"
- "What's the optimal path to maximize food collection?"
- "How do I balance risk (speed) vs. safety (careful movement)?"

**Energy System:**
- "Which breeding attempts give me the best return on energy spent?"
- "Should I spend energy now or wait for a better breeding opportunity?"

**Example from SupaSnake:**
When a player enters the Breeding Lab with 3 energy and sees two breeding options—one crosses two common snakes (predictable outcome), another crosses rare variants (uncertain outcome)—the problem becomes: "Which breeding choice maximizes my progress toward collection completion given my limited energy?"

## Step 2: Discover Hidden Problems

**Hidden Problems (Emerge naturally from gameplay):**

**Resource Optimization:**
- "I have enough DNA for one more breeding attempt today—should I breed for a missing common variant (guaranteed progress) or attempt a rare variant (exciting but risky)?"

**Collection Completion Order:**
- "If I complete Dynasty A first, I unlock variant X which helps me breed Dynasty B faster—what's the optimal completion sequence?"

**Session Planning:**
- "I have 15 minutes before work—do I spend energy on breeding (long-term progress) or play Classic Mode for immediate DNA income?"

**Social Comparison (Future):**
- "My friend completed Glacier Dynasty—what strategy did they use? Can I do it faster?"

**Meta-Game Optimization:**
- "Which daily login rewards should I prioritize to maximize breeding efficiency this week?"

**Example from SupaSnake:**
Players quickly discover the hidden problem: "Common variants give consistent progress, but rare variants create emotional peaks. How do I balance steady advancement (commons) vs. excitement (rares) to maintain motivation?" This wasn't explicitly taught—it emerged from gameplay.

---

## Step 3: Generate New Problems

**Sustaining Engagement Through Problem Generation:**

**Monthly Dynasty Expansions:**
- New dynasty = new problem space: "How do this dynasty's mechanics differ? What's the optimal breeding strategy?"
- Cross-dynasty breeding = compounding complexity: "Now that I have Glacier AND Venom dynasties, what new variants can I create?"

**Seasonal Variants:**
- Limited-time variants = urgency problem: "Can I breed this rare seasonal variant before the event ends?"

**Leaderboards (Future):**
- Competitive problem: "What strategy will get me into top 100 breeders this month?"

**Breeding Challenges (Future):**
- Constrained problems: "Breed a Generation 5 Glacier variant using only 10 DNA"

**Example from SupaSnake:**
After completing the first three dynasties, players face the **meta-problem**: "I've mastered basic breeding—what advanced techniques can I learn?" Introducing dynasty traits (speed, size, pattern variations) creates a new layer: "How do I breed for multiple desired traits simultaneously?"

## Step 4: Test Problem Quality

**Evaluating Whether Problems Are Good:**

**Goldilocks Challenge:**
- **Too Easy:** "Cross any two snakes" → No thought required, no satisfaction
- **Too Hard:** "Breed exact genetic sequence" → Feels impossible, frustrating
- **Just Right:** "Use these two dynasties to reach this target" → Requires planning, achievable, satisfying

**SupaSnake Application:**
Test breeding problems by tracking:
- **Time to solution:** 30-90 seconds ideal for mobile
- **Success rate:** 70-80% success after planning
- **Satisfaction:** Players report feeling clever, not lucky

**Clear Goals:**
- Bad: "Make your collection better"
- Good: "Breed 3 rare Glacier variants to complete this dynasty"

**Interesting Constraints:**
- Bad: "You can only breed twice per day" (feels punishing)
- Good: "You have 3 energy—choose your breeding attempts wisely" (feels strategic)

## SupaSnake-Specific Implementation

### Collection Lab

**Core Problem:** "Which variants should I prioritize to feel collection progress?"

**Design Solutions:**
- **Panini psychology:** Seeing mostly-complete dynasties creates "just one more" urgency
- **Visual progress bars:** Makes problem tangible ("I'm 7/10 on Glacier Dynasty")
- **Rarity tiers:** Creates sub-problems (easy commons first, exciting rares later)

**Problem Generation:**
- Introduce new dynasties monthly → resets problem space
- Add legendary variants → creates long-term aspiration problems

### Core Snake Game (Classic Mode)

**Core Problem:** "Can I beat my high score?"

**Design Solutions:**
- **Visible high score:** Makes problem clear
- **Score-per-food feedback:** Helps players understand solutions
- **Snake length = skill indicator:** Physical representation of problem-solving success

**Problem Generation:**
- **Daily challenges:** "Beat score X to earn bonus DNA"
- **Snake customization unlocks:** "Reach score Y to unlock new visual variant"

### Energy System

**Core Problem:** "How do I maximize value from limited energy?"

**Design Solutions:**
- **Transparent costs:** Players know exactly what each breeding attempt costs
- **DNA income sources:** Creates optimization problem (breed vs. play Classic Mode for income)
- **Energy regeneration clarity:** Players can plan sessions around energy availability

**Avoid:** Making energy feel like a **barrier** (work) rather than **strategic resource** (play). If players feel "I can't play because I'm out of energy," the problem has shifted from interesting challenge to frustrating limitation.

### Breeding Lab

**Core Problem:** "What breeding combination achieves my collection goal?"

**Design Solutions:**
- **Breeding calculator hints:** "This cross has 30% chance of target variant"
- **Generation display:** Makes breeding depth problem visible
- **Cross-preview:** Shows possible outcomes before spending DNA

**Hidden Problems Emerge:**
- Efficient breeders discover generation shortcuts
- Players learn probability management
- Community shares optimal breeding paths

## Tips for Success

✅ **DO:**
- **Make problems obvious:** Players should immediately understand "what am I trying to do here?"
- **Provide feedback:** Show progress toward problem solution (breeding progress bars, DNA accumulation)
- **Scale difficulty:** Early problems easy (breed any two snakes), late problems complex (breed specific traits across dynasties)
- **Celebrate solutions:** Satisfying animations/sounds when players solve problems (rare variant reveal, collection completion)
- **Generate new problems:** Monthly content ensures "I wonder what's next?" curiosity never ends

❌ **DON'T:**
- **Hide problems:** If players don't know what they're solving, they feel lost
- **Create unsolvable problems:** Breeding shouldn't feel random/impossible
- **Punish problem-solving:** Don't make energy feel like punishment for playing
- **Make problems tedious:** "Breed 100 common snakes" is a chore, not a problem
- **Recycle problems:** Once players master a problem type, introduce new variations

## Measuring Success

**Problem Quality Indicators:**

**Engagement Metrics:**
- Players spend energy immediately (problems are interesting)
- Players return at energy regeneration times (anticipating new problem-solving opportunities)
- Session length matches problem complexity (30-90 seconds for breeding decisions)

**Behavioral Signals:**
- Players use breeding calculator (actively planning solutions)
- Players screenshot rare variants (celebrating problem solved)
- Players discuss strategies in community (meta-problem solving)

**Failure Signals:**
- Players hoard energy (problems don't seem worth solving)
- Players randomly breed (problems unclear or uninteresting)
- Players quit before collection completion (problems became tedious)

## Example Application: Introducing New Dynasty

**Problem Design Checklist:**

1. **Core Problem:** "How do I breed all variants in this new dynasty?"
2. **Hidden Problem:** "What's the optimal cross between new dynasty and my existing dynasties?"
3. **New Problem Generation:** New traits create breeding strategy puzzles
4. **Problem Quality:** Test that first variant achievable in 2-3 attempts (not frustrating), but full collection takes 2-3 weeks (not trivial)
5. **Problem Clarity:** Dynasty description explains breeding rules clearly

**Result:** Players immediately understand what to solve, feel challenged but not overwhelmed, discover hidden optimization strategies, and look forward to next dynasty expansion.
