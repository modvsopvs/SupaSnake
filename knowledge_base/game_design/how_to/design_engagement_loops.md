# How to Design Engagement Loops Using Player Needs

**Schell's Principle:** Games fulfill basic human needs (Maslow's Hierarchy + Self-Determination Theory). Games covering more needs, especially more basic needs, create stronger motivation and longer retention. Multiplayer games excel because they fulfill Level 3 (love/belonging) which is more basic than Level 4 (self-esteem) served by most single-player games.

**SupaSnake Context:** Primarily solo mobile game must compensate for missing synchronous multiplayer (Level 3 weakness). Solution: Design engagement loops targeting multiple need levels simultaneously, with particular focus on competence, autonomy, and relatedness (SDT's three mental needs). Goal is 5-10 minute sessions that fulfill needs efficiently, driving 3+ daily returns.

## Overview

Engagement loops are repeating cycles that drive player behavior. Mobile F2P lives or dies by daily return rates—players must *want* to come back, not just *hafta*. This guide shows how to design SupaSnake's loops using psychological need fulfillment (Maslow + SDT) rather than manipulative obligation mechanics. Emma needs light, satisfying loops (15-30 minutes total daily). Tyler needs deep, skill-expressive loops (60+ minutes if desired).

**Core Loops Designed:**
1. **Snake Mastery Loop** (5-10 min): Competence need (SDT)
2. **Collection Progress Loop** (10-20 min): Esteem need (Maslow Level 4)
3. **Breeding Discovery Loop** (15-30 min): Self-Actualization (Maslow Level 5)
4. **Social Connection Loop** (5 min daily): Belonging need (Maslow Level 3)

## Step 1: Map Needs to SupaSnake Systems

**Schell's Framework:** Use Maslow's Hierarchy + Self-Determination Theory to identify which needs each system serves.

**Maslow's Hierarchy Applied:**

**Level 1 (Physiological) & Level 2 (Safety):**
- Not directly applicable to mobile games
- *Future consideration*: Fantasy framing (preserve snake species from extinction via breeding?)

**Level 3 (Love/Belonging - Relatedness):**
- **Clans (v0.5)**: Asynchronous social connection
- **Shared Discoveries**: Breeding combination community sharing
- **Leaderboards**: Indirect social comparison (Emma's motivator)
- **Weakness**: Solo-primary design underserves this level

**Level 4 (Self-Esteem - Competence):**
- **Snake Mastery**: Skill progression, high scores, perfect runs
- **Collection Completion**: Achievement through set bonuses (7/10 → 10/10 CYBER)
- **Leaderboard Ranks**: Social proof of competence
- **Strength**: Core SupaSnake focus

**Level 5 (Self-Actualization):**
- **Breeding Strategy**: Creative expression through genetic optimization
- **Personal Playstyle**: Unique dynasty focus, custom breeding paths
- **Discovery**: Finding rare variants, pioneering combinations
- **Strength**: Tyler's primary motivator

**Self-Determination Theory Applied:**

**Competence (Feel Good at Something):**
- Snake skill curve (novice → expert progression)
- DNA earning efficiency (visible improvement)
- Perfect run achievements (mastery validation)

**Autonomy (Freedom to Choose):**
- Voluntary play timing (energy creates scarcity, not obligation)
- Dynasty focus choice (CYBER vs PRIMAL vs SHADOW)
- Breeding path freedom (multiple optimal strategies)
- DNA spending decisions (buy variant now vs save for rare)

**Relatedness (Connect with Others):**
- Clan bonuses (mutual benefit from membership)
- Breeding sharing (community collaboration)
- Leaderboards (social comparison framework)

**Gap Analysis:**
- **Strong**: Competence (Maslow 4) + Autonomy (SDT)
- **Moderate**: Self-Actualization (Maslow 5)
- **Weak**: Relatedness (Maslow 3 + SDT)—solo-primary design limitation

## Step 2: Design Core Engagement Loop (Snake Mastery)

**Need Fulfilled:** Competence (SDT) + Self-Esteem (Maslow Level 4)
**Target Duration:** 5-10 minutes per session
**Target Frequency:** 3+ sessions daily
**Personas:** Both Emma and Tyler

**Loop Structure:**

**1. Trigger (Return Motivation):**
- **Energy Full** push notification (extrinsic reminder)
- Personal challenge ("Can I beat my 187 DNA record?") (intrinsic drive)
- New daily refill available (time-gated incentive)

**2. Action (Gameplay):**
- Play 3-5 Snake runs (1 energy each = 5-10 minutes)
- Each run: 90-120 seconds of skill-focused gameplay
- Immediate feedback: DNA earned, survival time, combos

**3. Reward (Need Fulfillment):**
- **Competence**: Improved performance visible (beat personal best)
- **Esteem**: DNA accumulation (tangible progress)
- **Judgment**: Run summary shows skill metrics (fair evaluation)

**4. Progress Investment (Retention Hook):**
- DNA banked toward next variant purchase (sunk cost)
- Survival time added to lifetime stats (cumulative achievement)
- Energy depleted (creates scarcity value for next session)

**5. Next Goal Setting (Forward Momentum):**
- "Need 50 more DNA for next variant" (concrete next step)
- "Can I beat 200 DNA in one run?" (skill challenge)
- "3 hours until full energy" (time-gated return trigger)

**Loop Validation:**
- ✅ Fulfills competence need (skill improves visibly)
- ✅ Intrinsically satisfying (Snake mastery is fun)
- ✅ Extrinsically rewarding (DNA progress)
- ✅ Natural stopping point (energy depleted)
- ✅ Clear return trigger (energy recharge)

---

## Step 3: Design Meta-Loop (Collection Progress)

**Need Fulfilled:** Self-Esteem (Maslow Level 4) + Competence (SDT)
**Target Duration:** 10-20 minutes per session
**Target Frequency:** 1-2 sessions daily
**Personas:** Emma-primary, Tyler-secondary

**Loop Structure:**

**1. Trigger:**
- Accumulated enough DNA for variant purchase (230 DNA threshold)
- Approaching set completion (7/10 CYBER variants)
- New dynasty released (monthly content drop)

**2. Action:**
- Browse Collection Lab (view locked variants)
- Purchase new variant (spend accumulated DNA)
- View updated progress (now 8/10 CYBER)

**3. Reward:**
- **Esteem**: Visible collection growth (Panini book satisfaction)
- **Competence**: Progress toward set bonus (strategic achievement)
- **Novelty**: New variant art/stats unlocked (discovery excitement)

**4. Progress Investment:**
- Set progress updated (closer to 10/10 = +10% DNA bonus)
- DNA depleted (creates next earning goal)
- New variant available for breeding (unlocks breeding loop)

**5. Next Goal Setting:**
- "2 more variants until CYBER complete!" (concrete milestone)
- "Next variant costs 350 DNA" (clear earning target)
- "Can I breed this new variant?" (leads to breeding loop)

**Loop Validation:**
- ✅ Fulfills esteem need (collection achievement)
- ✅ Builds on Snake loop (DNA earned → variant purchased)
- ✅ Creates long-term goal (set completion)
- ✅ Feeds into breeding loop (new variants = new combinations)
- ✅ Monthly refreshes (new dynasty resets novelty)

---

## Step 4: Design Discovery Loop (Breeding Strategy)

**Need Fulfilled:** Self-Actualization (Maslow Level 5) + Autonomy (SDT)
**Target Duration:** 15-30 minutes per session
**Target Frequency:** 2-3 sessions weekly
**Personas:** Tyler-primary, Emma-secondary

**Loop Structure:**

**1. Trigger:**
- Unlocked new variant (from collection loop)
- Discovered rare breeding combination (community sharing)
- Want to optimize DNA income (strategic goal)

**2. Action:**
- Experiment with breeding pairs (CYBER × PRIMAL)
- Generate offspring (generational progression)
- Discover variant rarities (exploration)

**3. Reward:**
- **Self-Actualization**: Creative problem-solving (strategic mastery)
- **Novelty**: Rare variant discovery (unexpected outcomes)
- **Autonomy**: Personal breeding path (unique strategy expression)
- **Competence**: Optimization success (efficient DNA boost)

**4. Progress Investment:**
- Breeding tree depth increases (generational achievement)
- Rare variants unlocked (hard-won accomplishments)
- DNA income optimized (strategic advantage for Snake loop)

**5. Next Goal Setting:**
- "What happens if I breed Generation 3 CYBER?" (experimentation curiosity)
- "Can I unlock all SHADOW variants via breeding?" (completionist challenge)
- "Community says PRIMAL×CRYSTAL gives rare—try it?" (social discovery)

**Loop Validation:**
- ✅ Fulfills self-actualization (creative expression)
- ✅ High autonomy (player-driven experimentation)
- ✅ Feeds back to collection loop (breeding unlocks variants)
- ✅ Supports Snake loop (better income = faster progression)
- ✅ Infinite depth potential (breeding combinations grow with content)

---

## Step 5: Design Social Loop (Relatedness)

**Need Fulfilled:** Love/Belonging (Maslow Level 3) + Relatedness (SDT)
**Target Duration:** 5 minutes daily
**Target Frequency:** Daily passive, weekly active
**Personas:** Emma-primary

**Loop Structure:**

**1. Trigger:**
- Clan bonus ready (+1 energy every 6 hours)
- Breeding discovery to share (rare variant found)
- Leaderboard position changed (social comparison)

**2. Action:**
- **Passive**: Collect clan energy bonus (daily check-in)
- **Active**: Share breeding combination (community contribution)
- **Active**: View clan leaderboard (social comparison)

**3. Reward:**
- **Relatedness**: Feel part of clan community (belonging)
- **Esteem**: Contribution recognized (shared discovery helps others)
- **Competence**: Leaderboard rank (social validation)

**4. Progress Investment:**
- Clan reputation built (long-term social capital)
- Shared discoveries credited (community contribution record)
- Clan bonuses accumulated (mutual benefit)

**5. Next Goal Setting:**
- "Clan needs more active members" (social goal)
- "Want to climb leaderboard from #47 to #25" (competitive drive)
- "Found rare combo—share with clan?" (social contribution opportunity)

**Loop Validation:**
- ✅ Fulfills relatedness need (social connection)
- ✅ Asynchronous (no scheduling burden)
- ✅ Optional (preserves autonomy)
- ✅ Mutually beneficial (clan bonuses help everyone)
- ⚠️ Light social (compensates for solo-primary design but doesn't replace synchronous multiplayer)

## Step 6: Interconnect Loops into Engagement Ecosystem

**Schell's Principle:** Needs feed into one another—fulfilling one creates motivation to fulfill others. SupaSnake loops must interlock, not compete.

**Loop Interconnections:**

**Snake Loop → Collection Loop:**
- Snake skill earns DNA (competence drives esteem progress)
- DNA accumulation triggers variant purchase (action leads to reward)
- Collection progress creates return goal (retention mechanism)

**Collection Loop → Breeding Loop:**
- New variants unlock breeding options (esteem enables self-actualization)
- Set bonuses boost DNA income (collection supports Snake efficiency)
- Breeding discoveries add collection value (loops reinforce)

**Breeding Loop → Snake Loop:**
- Optimized income increases DNA per run (strategy supports skill expression)
- Rare variants motivate Snake play to afford them (self-actualization creates competence goal)
- Generational progress requires DNA (loops depend on each other)

**All Loops → Social Loop:**
- Snake leaderboards (competence becomes social comparison)
- Collection completion sharing (esteem becomes relatedness)
- Breeding discoveries shared (self-actualization contributes to community)

**Social Loop → All Loops:**
- Clan bonuses increase energy (relatedness supports competence via more Snake runs)
- Community breeding tips improve strategy (relatedness enables self-actualization)
- Social comparison motivates skill improvement (relatedness drives competence)

**Ecosystem Health Check:**
- ✅ Loops reinforce (not compete)
- ✅ Multiple entry points (Emma enters via collection, Tyler via Snake skill)
- ✅ Multiple need levels served (3, 4, 5 on Maslow; all 3 SDT needs)
- ✅ Natural daily rhythm (3-5 Snake sessions, 1-2 collection sessions, weekly breeding)

## Step 7: Session Design for Mobile Context

**Schell's Principle:** Interest curves and pacing matter. Mobile sessions must fit into fragmented daily schedules.

**Session Type 1: Quick Snake (5 min):**
- **Trigger**: Energy full notification during commute
- **Action**: 3 Snake runs (drain energy)
- **Needs Fulfilled**: Competence (skill practice)
- **Exit**: Natural stopping point (energy depleted)
- **Next**: Return when energy recharged (100 min later)

**Session Type 2: Collection Browse (10 min):**
- **Trigger**: Accumulated 230+ DNA, lunch break
- **Action**: Purchase variant, browse progress
- **Needs Fulfilled**: Esteem (collection growth)
- **Exit**: DNA depleted or satisfied with progress
- **Next**: Return to earn more DNA via Snake

**Session Type 3: Breeding Experiment (20 min):**
- **Trigger**: Evening downtime, new variant unlocked
- **Action**: Try breeding combinations, discover outcomes
- **Needs Fulfilled**: Self-actualization (creative strategy)
- **Exit**: Curiosity satisfied or DNA cost too high
- **Next**: Return when new variants unlocked

**Session Type 4: Social Check (2 min):**
- **Trigger**: Daily morning routine
- **Action**: Collect clan bonus, view leaderboard
- **Needs Fulfilled**: Relatedness (social connection)
- **Exit**: Bonuses collected
- **Next**: Daily habit

**Daily Pattern (Emma):**
- Morning: Social check (2 min) + Quick Snake (5 min) = **7 min**
- Lunch: Quick Snake (5 min) + Collection browse (10 min) = **15 min**
- Evening: Quick Snake (5 min) = **5 min**
- **Total: 27 min daily** (fits casual player profile)

**Daily Pattern (Tyler):**
- Morning: Quick Snake (10 min, paid refill) = **10 min**
- Lunch: Breeding experiment (20 min) = **20 min**
- Evening: Extended Snake (15 min, multiple refills) + Collection (10 min) = **25 min**
- Late: Social check (5 min, leaderboard climb) = **5 min**
- **Total: 60 min daily** (fits engaged player profile)

## SupaSnake-Specific Implementation

**Core Snake Gameplay:**
- **Loop**: Play → Improve → Earn DNA → Return (5-10 min sessions)
- **Needs**: Competence (primary), Esteem (secondary via DNA)
- **Frequency**: 3+ daily sessions (energy gates create natural rhythm)

**Collection Lab:**
- **Loop**: Accumulate DNA → Purchase variant → Progress set → Next goal (10-20 min sessions)
- **Needs**: Esteem (primary via achievement), Competence (secondary via strategic choice)
- **Frequency**: 1-2 daily sessions (when DNA threshold reached)

**Energy System:**
- **Loop**: Deplete → Recharge → Return (100 min recharge cycle)
- **Needs**: Creates scarcity value (makes Snake runs matter)
- **Frequency**: Natural pacing for 3+ daily sessions (morning/lunch/evening)

**Dynasty/Breeding:**
- **Loop**: Unlock variants → Experiment combinations → Discover rare → Optimize (15-30 min sessions)
- **Needs**: Self-Actualization (primary), Autonomy (secondary via strategy freedom)
- **Frequency**: 2-3 weekly sessions (deeper engagement)

## Tips for Success

✅ **DO:**

- **Stack Need Fulfillment**: Each session should fulfill multiple needs (Snake = competence + esteem + judgment)
- **Create Natural Stops**: Energy depletion, DNA spending, curiosity satisfaction (not arbitrary interruptions)
- **Interconnect Loops**: Snake feeds collection, collection enables breeding, breeding improves Snake
- **Respect Autonomy**: Loops should invite, not obligate (no penalties for skipped sessions)
- **Serve Multiple Personas**: Emma finds esteem, Tyler finds self-actualization, both satisfied

❌ **DON'T:**

- **Force Single Loop**: Don't make players complete collection before breeding (allow parallel progression)
- **Create Obligation Loops**: No "daily login or lose progress" (preserves autonomy)
- **Ignore Relatedness**: Solo games need social features even if light (clans compensate)
- **Forget Mobile Context**: Loops must fit 5-10 min sessions (not 60 min console sessions)
- **Rely on Single Need**: Games serving only competence have weaker retention than multi-need games
