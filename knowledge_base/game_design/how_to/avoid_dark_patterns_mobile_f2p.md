**Timeline:** Apply from earliest design phase through entire development and post-launch

**Prerequisites:**
- Understanding of F2P business model (@quick_ref/concept_mobile_monetization.md)
- Commitment to ethical design (@quick_ref/concept_ethical_design.md)
- Clear designer purpose (@quick_ref/concept_designer_purpose.md)

## Overview

**Dark patterns** are design tricks that manipulate players into actions against their best interests - usually spending money or time they didn't intend to. They're common in mobile F2P, but they're not necessary for profitability.

**SupaSnake proves ethical F2P works** - by explicitly rejecting every dark pattern and designing respectful alternatives that still generate revenue.

---

## Step 1: Identify Dark Patterns to Avoid

**Know the enemy to reject it consciously.**

### Common Mobile F2P Dark Patterns

**1. Predatory Loot Boxes**
- **Pattern:** Purchase unknown contents, extremely low odds for desired items
- **Psychology:** Gambling addiction, "just one more try"
- **Example:** $5 gem pack with 0.1% chance for legendary character
- **Harm:** Players spend hundreds chasing specific item, feel cheated afterward

**2. FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)**
- **Pattern:** Limited-time offers, daily login rewards, ticking countdown timers
- **Psychology:** Anxiety about missing content, pressure to play daily
- **Example:** "24 HOURS ONLY! Miss this and it's GONE FOREVER!"
- **Harm:** Players feel forced to play even when not enjoying, anxiety about breaks

**3. Pay-to-Win**
- **Pattern:** Competitive advantage sold for money, impossible to compete F2P
- **Psychology:** Arms race of spending to maintain status
- **Example:** PvP where paying players have 10× power of F2P
- **Harm:** F2P players feel hopeless, whales spend thousands in competitive spiral

**4. Hidden Costs**
- **Pattern:** Obfuscated pricing, premium currencies hiding real cost, surprise charges
- **Psychology:** Confusion prevents informed decisions
- **Example:** 1200 gems = $9.99, item costs 1150 gems (must buy two packs = $20)
- **Harm:** Players spend more than intended, feel tricked

**5. Grinding Walls**
- **Pattern:** Tedious repetition required for progress, or pay to skip
- **Psychology:** Time pressure converts to spending, gameplay becomes work
- **Example:** 100 hours of boring grinding OR $20 to skip
- **Harm:** Fun replaced with tedium, pay-to-skip exploits sunk cost

**6. Social Pressure**
- **Pattern:** "Your friends are ahead!", public spending displays, forced sharing
- **Psychology:** Shame, comparison, social obligation
- **Example:** "Jimmy spent $50 and unlocked Golden Dragon! You're falling behind!"
- **Harm:** Toxic comparison, damaged friendships, shame-based spending

**7. Bait and Switch**
- **Pattern:** Advertise free game, then paywall core features; tutorial easy, then wall hits
- **Psychology:** Sunk cost ("I already invested time...")
- **Example:** First 10 levels free and fun, then impossible without paying
- **Harm:** Players feel deceived, trapped by time investment

**8. Exploit Loops**
- **Pattern:** Target addiction vulnerabilities, encourage compulsive behavior, no spending limits
- **Psychology:** Addiction, compulsion, loss of control
- **Example:** "Whales" spend $10,000+ per month, game actively encourages it
- **Harm:** Financial ruin, addiction, psychological harm

## Step 2: Design Ethical Alternatives

**For every dark pattern, there's an ethical alternative that still generates revenue.**

### Ethical Alternative Framework

**Core Principles:**
1. **Transparency:** Players know exactly what they're getting and what it costs
2. **Respect:** Value player time, money, and well-being
3. **Fairness:** Spending enhances, doesn't gatekeep or dominate
4. **Consent:** Players choose freely, without manipulation
5. **Protection:** Systems prevent harmful spending patterns

### SupaSnake's Ethical Alternatives

**Instead of Loot Boxes → Transparent Breeding**

**Dark Pattern:**
```
"$4.99 Mystery Egg"
- 80% common snake
- 15% rare snake
- 4.9% epic snake
- 0.1% legendary snake
[Buy without knowing what you'll get]
```

**Ethical Alternative:**
```
Breeding System:
- Shows exact probabilities BEFORE committing
- Aquaria (Common) × Voltage (Rare) =
  • 60% Aquaria variant
  • 30% Voltage variant
  • 10% hybrid AquaVolt
- Player makes informed decision
- DNA cost transparent (50 DNA = $0.50 equivalent)
```

**Why ethical:** No gambling, no surprise, player agency

---

**Instead of FOMO Timers → Permanent Content**

**Dark Pattern:**
```
"FLASH SALE!
Legendary Dragon available for 24 HOURS ONLY!
Miss this and NEVER GET ANOTHER CHANCE!"
[Countdown timer inducing anxiety]
```

**Ethical Alternative:**
```
SupaSnake Dynasties:
- All dynasties always available
- New dynasties added monthly (expand catalog)
- Previous dynasties remain accessible
- No time pressure, play at your pace
```

**Why ethical:** Respects player schedule, no artificial urgency

---

**Instead of Pay-to-Win → Skill-Based + Cosmetic Value**

**Dark Pattern:**
```
PvP Arena:
- Pay $50 → +500% damage
- F2P players can't compete
- Leaderboard = spending leaderboard
```

**Ethical Alternative:**
```
SupaSnake Leaderboards:
- Classic Mode = pure skill (no energy cost)
- All players equal power level
- Practice improves score, not spending
- Collection value = cosmetic (personal satisfaction)
- Breeding enables collection faster, doesn't buy wins
```

**Why ethical:** Spending can't buy competitive advantage, skill matters

---

**Instead of Hidden Costs → Transparent Pricing**

**Dark Pattern:**
```
1200 gems = $9.99
Item costs 1150 gems
(Forces buying 2 packs = $19.98 for item worth ~$9.50)
Premium currency obfuscates real cost
```

**Ethical Alternative:**
```
SupaSnake Energy:
- 10 energy = $0.10 (always clear)
- Breeding costs shown in both energy AND dollar equivalent
- Example: "Breed: 50 energy ($0.50)"
- No confusing conversion, simple math
```

**Why ethical:** Players know exactly what they're spending

---

**Instead of Grinding → Fun Core Loop**

**Dark Pattern:**
```
Level 20 → 100 hours of boring repetitive battles
OR
Pay $20 to skip to level 20
[Tedium converts to spending]
```

**Ethical Alternative:**
```
SupaSnake Core Gameplay:
- Snake is inherently fun (not tedious)
- Playing earns DNA (rewarding, not grinding)
- Energy enables MORE play, not skip-grinding
- F2P pace slower but ENJOYABLE
- No "pay to skip boredom" because there's no boredom
```

**Why ethical:** Gameplay is fun whether spending or not

---

**Instead of Social Pressure → Positive Community**

**Dark Pattern:**
```
"Your friend Sarah spent $100 this week!
You're falling behind!
Show her who's boss - BUY NOW!"
[Shame-based spending encouragement]
```

**Ethical Alternative:**
```
SupaSnake Social:
- Friend leaderboards compare SKILL (Classic Mode)
- Celebrate others' rare breeds (no jealousy)
- Share strategies (collaborative discovery)
- No public spending amounts
- Community helps newcomers (positive culture)
```

**Why ethical:** Social features build connection, not shame

---

**Instead of Bait and Switch → Honest Progression**

**Dark Pattern:**
```
Tutorial: Easy, fun, rewarding
Level 10: Suddenly impossible without $20 purchase
[Player invested time, feels trapped]
```

**Ethical Alternative:**
```
SupaSnake Onboarding:
- Tutorial shows actual gameplay
- F2P path clear from start
- Energy system explained upfront
- No sudden difficulty spike
- Progression curve consistent
```

**Why ethical:** Honest about what game is, no trap

---

**Instead of Exploit Loops → Spending Caps**

**Dark Pattern:**
```
No spending limit
"Whales" encouraged to spend $1000+/month
Actively targets addiction vulnerabilities
VIP tiers reward excessive spending
```

**Ethical Alternative:**
```
SupaSnake Energy Cap:
- Maximum 120 energy stored
- = $6/day spending ceiling
- Prevents whaling
- Protects vulnerable players
- Can't spend excessively even if wanted to
```

**Why ethical:** System prevents harmful spending, protects players from themselves

---

## Step 3: Implement Transparency Systems

**Make everything visible and understandable.**

### Probability Disclosure

**Requirement: Show exact odds BEFORE purchase/action.**

**SupaSnake Implementation:**
```typescript
// Breeding screen shows before committing DNA
interface BreedingProbabilities {
  outcomes: [
    { variant: "Aquaria Common", probability: "60%", rarity: "Common" },
    { variant: "Voltage Rare", probability: "30%", rarity: "Rare" },
    { variant: "AquaVolt Hybrid", probability: "10%", rarity: "Epic" }
  ];
  cost: {
    energy: 50,
    dollarEquivalent: "$0.50"
  };
}

// Player sees full information before clicking "Breed"
```

**Result:** No surprises, informed decisions, no loot box psychology

### Pricing Clarity

**Requirement: Show real money cost clearly.**

**SupaSnake Implementation:**
```typescript
// Energy purchase screen
interface EnergyPackage {
  energy: 100,
  cost: "$1.00",  // Prominently displayed
  valuePerEnergy: "$0.01",  // Transparent unit economics
  equivalentBreedings: "2 breedings",  // Practical value explained
}

// In-game actions show cost immediately
BreedButton: "Breed (50 energy / $0.50)"
```

**Result:** Players always know what they're spending

### Progress Transparency

**Requirement: Show F2P path clearly.**

**SupaSnake Implementation:**
```typescript
// Collection screen shows F2P completability
interface DynastyProgress {
  variants: 15,
  collected: 8,
  freeEnergyPath: {
    timeToComplete: "~30 days at 2 hrs/day F2P",
    energyRequired: "Total ~750 energy",
    dailyFreeEnergy: "~25 energy/day (regeneration)"
  },
  speedUpOption: {
    purchasedEnergy: "+25 energy/day",
    timeToComplete: "~15 days",
    totalCost: "~$18.75"
  }
}
```

**Result:** Players see F2P is viable, spending accelerates but doesn't gatekeep

---

## Step 4: Build Player Protection Systems

**Prevent harmful patterns proactively.**

### Spending Limits

**Implement hard caps on spending.**

**SupaSnake Energy Cap:**
```typescript
const ENERGY_CAP = 120;  // Maximum energy storage
const ENERGY_PURCHASE_LIMIT = 100;  // Max purchase at once
const DAILY_SPENDING_ESTIMATE = ENERGY_CAP * ENERGY_COST;  // ~$6/day

function preventExcessiveSpending() {
  if (player.energy >= ENERGY_CAP) {
    showMessage("Energy full! Come back later for more.");
    disableEnergyPurchase();
  }

  if (player.dailySpending >= DAILY_SPENDING_ESTIMATE) {
    showMessage("Daily energy cap reached. Play Classic Mode or return tomorrow!");
    disableEnergyPurchase();
  }
}
```

**Result:** Even if player wants to whale, system prevents it

### Natural Stopping Points

**Design gameplay to end naturally, not loop infinitely.**

**SupaSnake Sessions:**
```typescript
// Energy depletion creates natural stopping point
function handleEnergyDepletion() {
  if (player.energy === 0) {
    showMessage(
      "Out of energy! Come back in 10 minutes for free refill, " +
      "or play Classic Mode (always free)."
    );
    suggestClassicMode();  // Positive alternative, not pressure to buy
  }
}

// Classic Mode has natural endpoint (you die)
function snakeGameOver() {
  showScore();
  suggestRetry();  // But not infinite loop - players naturally stop
}
```

**Result:** Players have reason to stop, preventing compulsive play

### Cooldown Systems

**Use time as pacing mechanism, not FOMO.**

**SupaSnake Energy Regeneration:**
```typescript
const ENERGY_REGEN_RATE = 1;  // 1 energy per minute
const ENERGY_REGEN_CAP = 120;

// Regeneration is GIFT, not pressure
function energyRegeneration() {
  if (player.energy < ENERGY_REGEN_CAP) {
    player.energy += ENERGY_REGEN_RATE;
    // NO notification spam
    // NO "Energy full!" guilt-trip
    // Just quiet regeneration respecting player's time
  }
}
```

**Result:** Time gates spending, but doesn't create FOMO

---

## Step 5: Test for Manipulation

**Actively audit your design for dark patterns.**

### The Ethics Checklist

**Before launching any monetization feature, ask:**

**Transparency:**
- [ ] Do players know exactly what they're buying?
- [ ] Are odds displayed clearly before purchase?
- [ ] Is pricing obvious and not obfuscated?
- [ ] Can players calculate value easily?

**Respect:**
- [ ] Does this respect player time?
- [ ] Does this respect player money?
- [ ] Does this respect player agency?
- [ ] Would I want my own family to experience this?

**Fairness:**
- [ ] Can F2P players complete content?
- [ ] Does spending create unfair advantage?
- [ ] Is competition skill-based or wallet-based?
- [ ] Do whales get proportional value?

**Protection:**
- [ ] Are there spending caps?
- [ ] Are there natural stopping points?
- [ ] Does this prevent addiction patterns?
- [ ] Are vulnerable players protected?

**Honesty:**
- [ ] Would this survive investigative journalism?
- [ ] Would I defend this on stage at GDC?
- [ ] Is marketing accurate to gameplay?
- [ ] Are there hidden mechanics or costs?

**If ANY answer is "no," redesign the feature.**

### User Testing for Dark Patterns

**Watch for red flag behaviors in playtesting:**

**Concerning Patterns:**
- Players feeling pressured to spend
- Frustration about "having to" play
- Confusion about costs or value
- Feeling tricked or deceived
- Anxiety about missing content
- Compulsive checking despite not enjoying
- Shame about spending amounts

**Healthy Patterns:**
- Players choosing to spend freely
- Natural stopping points respected
- Clear understanding of value
- Joy in gameplay (spending or not)
- Comfortable with breaks
- Healthy relationship with game

**If concerning patterns emerge, investigate and redesign.**

---

## Step 6: Market Ethically

**No dark patterns in marketing either.**

### Honest Advertising

**Show actual gameplay, not idealized fantasy.**

**Dark Pattern Marketing:**
```
App Store Screenshots:
- Photoshopped perfect UI
- Gameplay that doesn't exist
- "WIN $1000 REAL MONEY!" (fake)
- Bait gameplay (shown) vs. actual game (hidden)
```

**Ethical Marketing:**
```
SupaSnake App Store:
- Real screenshots from actual game
- Video shows authentic Snake gameplay
- Feature list accurate (no lying)
- "Breeding strategy game" (exactly what it is)
- Reviews not incentivized or fake
```

### No Predatory Targeting

**Don't exploit vulnerable demographics.**

**Dark Patterns:**
- Targeting children with monetization
- Targeting gambling addicts with loot boxes
- Targeting lonely people with social pressure
- Targeting whales with VIP systems

**Ethical Approach:**
- Age-gate appropriately (13+ for SupaSnake)
- No features targeting addiction
- Social features build connection, not exploit loneliness
- Spending caps protect everyone equally

---

## Step 7: Maintain Ethics Post-Launch

**Ethical design is ongoing commitment, not one-time decision.**

### Monitor for Drift

**Watch for unintended dark patterns emerging:**

**Regular Audits:**
- Monthly review of spending patterns
- Check for whales spending excessively (cap working?)
- Analyze session lengths (healthy or compulsive?)
- Review player feedback for manipulation concerns
- Compare retention to industry (too high = addiction?)

**Example Drift:**
- Energy cap working initially
- Players discover bug to bypass cap
- Instead of exploit, it's dark pattern opportunity
- **Ethical response:** Fix bug, protect cap integrity

### Community Feedback

**Players will tell you if you're manipulating them:**

**Listen For:**
- "This feels predatory"
- "I feel pressured to spend"
- "This is like gambling"
- "I can't stop playing even though I'm not having fun"
- "This feels disrespectful of my time/money"

**Don't dismiss ethical concerns as "just complainers."**

### Resist Revenue Pressure

**When revenue is low, temptation to add dark patterns increases.**

**Common Pressures:**
- "Just add small loot box..."
- "Everyone uses FOMO timers..."
- "Lower the energy cap to increase spending..."
- "Add some pay-to-win for whales..."

**Ethical Resistance:**
- **Remember purpose:** Proving ethical F2P works
- **Long-term thinking:** Dark patterns erode trust, harm long-term revenue
- **Reputation:** Your ethics are your brand differentiation
- **Sleep well:** Revenue isn't worth compromising values

**If SupaSnake can't succeed ethically, that's valuable data. Don't compromise to force success.**

## Common Mistakes

**❌ "It's Just a Small Dark Pattern":**
- No such thing - erosion starts small
- Players notice, trust erodes
- Slippery slope to full exploitation

**❌ "Everyone Else Does It":**
- Race to bottom helps no one
- Your ethics are competitive advantage
- Stand out by being respectful

**❌ "Players Can Control Themselves":**
- Abdicates designer responsibility
- Systems designed to manipulate work
- Vulnerable players harmed most

**❌ "We'll Add Ethics Later":**
- Baked-in dark patterns hard to remove
- Player expectations set early
- Ethical foundation must be first

**❌ "Revenue Justifies Means":**
- Short-term revenue, long-term reputation damage
- Players remember being exploited
- Your purpose matters more than money
