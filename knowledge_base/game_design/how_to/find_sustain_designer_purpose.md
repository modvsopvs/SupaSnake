# How to Find and Sustain Designer Purpose

**Goal:** Discover your authentic purpose as a game designer and build sustainable practices that keep you aligned with that purpose over decades.

**Timeline:** Initial discovery (1-2 weeks of reflection), ongoing maintenance (monthly check-ins)

**Prerequisites:**
- Honest self-reflection
- Willingness to question motivations
- Commitment to sustainable creative practice

---

## Overview

**Purpose is the "why" that sustains you** through difficult development, guides tough decisions, and defines your legacy. Without clear purpose, you're vulnerable to external pressures, burnout, and compromising your values.

**Schell's Core Insight:** "Your purpose is not what you do (make games), but WHY you do it. Money is a requirement, not a purpose. Find the deeper reason that would drive you to make games even if no one paid you."

---

## Step 1: Discover Your Purpose

**Purpose comes from honest self-examination, not external expectations.**

### Reflective Questions

**Answer these honestly (write responses):**

**Motivation Questions:**
1. Why did you start making games?
2. What excites you most about game development?
3. When do you feel most fulfilled in your work?
4. What would you work on even if you weren't paid?
5. What impact do you want to have on players?
6. What change do you want to create in the industry?
7. What would make you proudest about your career?

**Boundary Questions:**
8. What would make you abandon a project?
9. What would you never do for money?
10. What compromises are dealbreakers?
11. What keeps you up at night (good or bad)?
12. What do you want to be remembered for?

**Value Questions:**
13. What matters more than success to you?
14. What principles guide your decisions?
15. Who do you want to help through your work?
16. What problems do you want to solve?
17. What legacy do you want to leave?

**Write freely for 20-30 minutes per question. Patterns will emerge.**

### Example: SupaSnake Purpose Discovery

**Motivation Answers:**
- Started: "Want to prove ethical mobile F2P can work"
- Excites: "Showing players mobile can be deep and strategic"
- Fulfillment: "When players say 'I didn't know mobile could be like this!'"
- Unpaid work: "Would make games to explore design ideas regardless"
- Player impact: "Transform casual players into strategic thinkers"
- Industry change: "Raise F2P standards, inspire ethical indie devs"
- Proudest: "Being cited as ethical F2P pioneer"

**Boundary Answers:**
- Abandon if: "Required adding loot boxes or dark patterns"
- Never do: "Exploit vulnerable players for profit"
- Dealbreakers: "Pay-to-win, predatory monetization, dishonesty"
- Keeps up: "Am I building something I'm proud of?"
- Remembered for: "Integrity and player respect"

**Value Answers:**
- More than success: "Maintaining integrity, helping others, sustainable health"
- Principles: "Transparency, respect, fairness, protection, honesty"
- Want to help: "Casual mobile players, other indie devs, future self"
- Problems: "Mobile F2P exploitation, indie dev burnout"
- Legacy: "Proof ethical F2P works, helped others succeed ethically"

**Emerging Purpose:**
"Create ethical mobile F2P games that respect players and prove treating people well is good business, while building sustainable indie career and eventually mentoring others."

### Synthesize Your Purpose

**Template: "I make games to [impact] by [approach] so that [outcome]."**

**SupaSnake Example:**
"I make games to **transform casual players into strategic thinkers** by **creating ethical F2P mobile experiences** so that **I build a sustainable career proving integrity and profitability coexist, eventually helping other indie devs succeed ethically.**"

**Your purpose should:**
- Resonate emotionally (feels true and exciting)
- Guide decisions (answers "should I do this?")
- Sustain motivation (works through hard times)
- Reflect values (aligns with who you are)
- Inspire action (makes you want to work)

---

## Step 2: Align Design with Purpose

**Every design decision should serve your purpose.**

### Purpose-Driven Design Framework

**Decision-Making Process:**
```
Design Question → Check Purpose → Decide

Example:
Q: Should I add daily login bonuses?
Purpose Check:
- Does this respect player time? (No - creates FOMO)
- Is this ethical F2P? (No - manipulative retention)
- Does this serve my purpose? (No - contradicts values)
Decision: No daily login bonuses
Alternative: Energy regeneration (respects time, no FOMO)
```

### SupaSnake Purpose Alignment

**Design Decisions Aligned with Purpose:**

**Ethical F2P Purpose:**
- Energy cap = Prevents whaling (protects players)
- Transparent breeding = No loot box manipulation (honesty)
- Classic Mode free = Skill-based value (fairness)
- F2P completion = Accessible (respect)

**Transform Players Purpose:**
- Strategic breeding = Teaches resource management
- Probability display = Makes genetics intuitive
- Collection curation = Portfolio thinking skills
- Progressive complexity = Gradual mastery

**Sustainable Career Purpose:**
- Solo scope = Achievable alone (prevents burnout)
- Iterative releases = Ship and learn (pragmatic)
- Portfolio quality = Professional showcase
- Open docs = Eventual mentorship foundation

**Each system serves at least one purpose dimension.**

### Red Flag: Purpose Misalignment

**If considering feature that contradicts purpose:**
1. **Pause:** Don't implement yet
2. **Question:** Why am I considering this?
3. **Pressure:** Is external pressure overriding purpose?
4. **Alternatives:** Can I achieve goal ethically?
5. **Decide:** Align with purpose or reject feature

**Example:**
- **Feature:** Loot boxes for rare variants
- **Pressure:** "Could increase revenue 3×"
- **Purpose Conflict:** Contradicts ethical F2P core purpose
- **Alternative:** Transparent breeding with clear odds
- **Decision:** Reject loot boxes, use ethical alternative

**Purpose is your compass when revenue pressure mounts.**

## Step 3: Build Sustainable Practices

**Purpose needs sustainable practices to endure.**

### Physical Sustainability

**Protect your body:**

**Daily Habits:**
- Sleep 7-9 hours (non-negotiable)
- Exercise 30+ min (movement breaks from desk)
- Healthy eating (brain fuel)
- Eye breaks (20-20-20 rule: every 20 min, 20 sec, 20 feet away)
- Ergonomics (standing desk, good chair, monitor height)

**SupaSnake Schedule:**
- Work 9am-12pm, 2pm-5pm (6 hours focused work)
- Exercise 12pm-1pm (midday break)
- Evenings free (family/hobbies)
- Weekends off (recovery)
- No crunch (sustainable pace)

**Result:** Can work this way for 30 years, not burn out in 6 months

### Mental Sustainability

**Protect your mind:**

**Practices:**
- Therapy/counseling (process stress, celebrate wins)
- Journaling (daily reflection, pattern recognition)
- Meditation (10 min daily, mindfulness)
- Creative recovery (non-gamedev hobbies)
- Learning time (not just production, also growth)

**SupaSnake Mental Health:**
- Weekly journaling (progress, learnings, feelings)
- Monthly therapy (process solo dev challenges)
- Side hobby (music production, separate from gamedev)
- Learning budget (courses, books, conferences)
- Celebrate small wins (completed feature → nice dinner)

**Result:** Mental health protected, growth mindset maintained

### Emotional Sustainability

**Protect your heart:**

**Practices:**
- Process setbacks (don't internalize failure)
- Celebrate progress (not just final product)
- Community support (indie dev Discord, local meetups)
- Boundaries (can say "no" to requests)
- Self-compassion (mistakes are learning, not character flaws)

**SupaSnake Emotional Practices:**
- Post-milestone reflection (what went well, what learned)
- Share progress publicly (get external validation)
- Indie dev community (others understand struggles)
- "No" practice (scope creep, feature requests, bad advice)
- Affirmations ("I'm learning. This is hard and that's okay.")

**Result:** Emotional resilience, doesn't quit when hard

### Financial Sustainability

**Protect your finances:**

**Practices:**
- Save 6-12 months runway before going indie
- Conservative revenue estimates
- Backup income plan (contract work, part-time)
- Budget for dev costs (software, art, audio, marketing)
- Don't bet rent money on game success

**SupaSnake Financial Plan:**
- Saved $18,000 runway (6 months living expenses)
- Estimate $500/month revenue year 1 (conservative)
- Contract work available if needed ($3k/month part-time)
- Dev costs budgeted ($2k for art, audio, tools)
- Success measured over years, not months

**Result:** Financial stress minimized, can develop sustainably

### Social Sustainability

**Maintain relationships outside gamedev:**

**Practices:**
- Weekly family time (present, not distracted)
- Friend hangouts (monthly minimum)
- Non-gamedev social activities (hiking, board games, etc.)
- Partner/spouse communication (share progress, listen to concerns)
- Isolation prevention (leave house, socialize)

**SupaSnake Social Practices:**
- Friday family dinner (no gamedev talk)
- Monthly friend game night (non-digital games)
- Weekly hiking (physical + social + nature)
- Daily partner check-in (how was dev? how are you?)
- Attend local indie dev meetups (every other month)

**Result:** Gamedev doesn't consume entire identity and social life

## Step 4: Navigate Purpose Challenges

**Purpose will be tested. Prepare responses.**

### Common Challenges to Purpose

**1. Revenue Pressure**
- **Challenge:** "Game isn't making enough money"
- **Temptation:** Add dark patterns for quick revenue
- **Purpose Response:** "My purpose is proving ethical works. If it fails ethically, that's valuable data. Won't compromise."
- **Action:** Double down on ethical alternatives, improve marketing, patience

**2. Peer Pressure**
- **Challenge:** "Other devs use loot boxes and make millions"
- **Temptation:** "Maybe I should copy them..."
- **Purpose Response:** "My purpose is raising standards, not following crowd. I'm proving something different."
- **Action:** Focus on differentiation, ignore peers' choices

**3. Publisher/Client Demands**
- **Challenge:** "Publisher wants pay-to-win features"
- **Temptation:** "Need their funding to finish..."
- **Purpose Response:** "My purpose requires integrity. No deal is worth compromising values."
- **Action:** Walk away from deals that contradict purpose

**4. Burnout Risk**
- **Challenge:** "Behind schedule, need to crunch"
- **Temptation:** "Just this once, work 80 hours/week..."
- **Purpose Response:** "My purpose includes sustainability. Crunch means bad planning, not solution."
- **Action:** Cut scope, extend timeline, maintain healthy pace

**5. Comparison to Others**
- **Challenge:** "AAA team shipped amazing game, mine looks worse"
- **Temptation:** "I'm a failure, give up"
- **Purpose Response:** "My purpose is my path, not theirs. Solo dev different from 100-person team."
- **Action:** Celebrate own progress, stop comparing to different contexts

**Prepare responses to common challenges in advance. Easier to resist in moment.**

### Decision Framework Under Pressure

**When facing difficult decision:**
1. **Pause:** Take 24 hours before deciding
2. **Purpose Check:** Does this align with my purpose?
3. **Values Check:** Does this align with my values?
4. **Consequences:** What happens if I do/don't?
5. **Regret Test:** Which choice will I regret in 10 years?
6. **Decide:** Choose purpose-aligned option

**Even if it's harder short-term, purpose-aligned choices compound positively.**

---

## Step 5: Evolve Purpose Consciously

**Purpose can evolve, but core values should remain.**

### Healthy Purpose Evolution

**Example Evolution:**
- **Year 1:** "Learn mobile F2P development"
- **Year 2:** "Ship ethical mobile F2P game"
- **Year 3:** "Prove ethical F2P profitable"
- **Year 5:** "Help other indie devs succeed ethically"
- **Year 10:** "Be known for ethical game design"

**Core value constant: Ethics. Specific purpose evolves with growth.**

### Unhealthy Purpose Drift

**Warning Signs:**
- Justifying dark patterns ("just this once")
- Losing joy in work (chasing money instead)
- Compromising values repeatedly
- Resentment building
- Work consuming life unsustainably

**If experiencing drift, return to Step 1 (rediscover purpose).**

### Annual Purpose Review

**Once per year, revisit purpose:**

**Review Questions:**
1. Does my stated purpose still resonate?
2. Are my actions aligned with purpose?
3. Has my purpose evolved naturally?
4. Do I need to recommit to original purpose?
5. What adjustments would realign me?

**Write updated purpose statement annually. Track evolution.**

---

## Step 6: Share Purpose Publicly

**Public commitment strengthens resolve.**

### Why Share Purpose

**Benefits:**
- **Accountability:** Others will notice if you drift
- **Attract Aligned:** Players/collaborators who share values find you
- **Inspire Others:** Your purpose helps others find theirs
- **Brand Differentiation:** Stand out through authentic values

**SupaSnake Public Purpose:**
- About page: "Building ethical mobile F2P..."
- Marketing: "Respectful monetization..."
- Community: "We prove ethical works..."
- Social media: "Indie dev journey building with integrity..."

**Result:** Audience knows what I stand for, holds me accountable

### Where to Share

**Public Platforms:**
- Game about/description (what you stand for)
- Developer website/portfolio (your values)
- Social media bio (purpose statement)
- Dev blog posts (purpose journey)
- Conference talks (purpose-driven design)
- Postmortems (how purpose guided decisions)

**Don't hide your values. They're your competitive advantage.**

---

## Step 7: Build Purpose Into Team (If Growing)

**When hiring, purpose alignment is critical.**

### Hiring for Purpose

**Questions to Ask Candidates:**
- "What are your values as a designer?"
- "What games make you proud? Ashamed?"
- "How do you feel about mobile F2P dark patterns?"
- "What impact do you want to have on players?"
- "What would make you quit a project?"

**Hire for values alignment, train for skills.**

### Team Purpose Alignment

**Onboarding includes:**
- Studio purpose statement
- Design principles document
- Examples of purpose-driven decisions
- Red lines (what we never do)
- Case studies (purpose under pressure)

**Result:** Whole team shares purpose, reinforces each other

### Maintaining Purpose at Scale

**As team grows:**
- Regular purpose discussions (monthly all-hands)
- Decision-making framework shared
- Purpose mentioned in every project brief
- Celebrate purpose-aligned wins
- Address drift quickly

**Purpose becomes culture, not just individual commitment.**

## Common Mistakes

**❌ Confusing Purpose with Goals:**
- Goal: "Make $1 million"
- Purpose: "Help players discover joy in strategy"
- Purpose guides, goals measure - don't confuse them

**❌ Adopting Others' Purpose:**
- Your purpose must be authentic to you
- "I should care about X" ≠ "I authentically care about X"

**❌ Purpose Without Sustainability:**
- Noble purpose + burnout = abandoning purpose
- Must build sustainable practices around purpose

**❌ Rigid Purpose:**
- Allow natural evolution
- Core values constant, but specifics can grow

**❌ Hidden Purpose:**
- If you don't share it, others can't hold you accountable
- Public purpose strengthens commitment

---

## Quick Reference

**Find and Sustain Purpose:**
1. **Discover:** Reflect deeply on why you make games (honest answers)
2. **Synthesize:** Write clear purpose statement that resonates
3. **Align:** Make every design decision serve your purpose
4. **Sustain:** Build healthy practices (physical, mental, emotional, financial, social)
5. **Navigate:** Prepare responses to challenges (revenue, peer, burnout pressures)
6. **Evolve:** Allow natural growth while maintaining core values
7. **Share:** Public purpose creates accountability and attracts aligned people

**Core Principle:** Purpose is the "why" that sustains you through decades of work. Without it, external pressures will steer you into burnout or ethical compromise.
