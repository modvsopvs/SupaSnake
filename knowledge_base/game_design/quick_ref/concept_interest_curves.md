# Interest Curves - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (3rd Edition, 2020), Chapter 16

## Core Concept

Interest curves chart player interest over time. Good curve: Hook → Rising interest with rest periods → Grand finale. Bad curve: No hook → Declining interest → Crosses interest threshold (player quits). Curves can be fractal (overall game has curve, each level has curve, each challenge has curve). Use to identify boring spots and reorder content for better pacing.

## Ideal Interest Curve Shape

**Hook (Start):** Grab attention immediately (opening movie, exciting first round)
**Rising Action:** Gradually increase interest with peaks and valleys (rest periods)
**Grand Finale:** Climax more interesting than everything else
**Resolution:** End with interest still high ("leave them wanting more")

## Interest Factors

**Inherent Interest:** Some events naturally more interesting (risk > safety, unusual > ordinary, dramatic change)
**Poetry of Presentation:** Beauty of artistry (music, graphics, animation quality)
**Projection:** Player puts themselves in experience (empathy with characters, immersion in world)

## Application to SupaSnake

**Single Round Curve (5-7 rounds per session):**
- Hook: Variant preview (shows what's possible this round)
- Rising: Speed increases, rare variants appear
- Peak: Legendary variant spawns (if lucky)
- Resolution: Round ends, DNA tallied

**Session Curve (Emma's 5-10 min):**
- Hook: Round 1 quick DNA collection
- Rising: Rounds 2-5 build speed/challenge
- Peak: Round 6-7 high-speed legendary chase
- Resolution: Energy depletes, session stats shown

**Long-Term Curve (Tyler's weeks of play):**
- Hook: First variant unlock
- Rising: Complete first dynasty (Common → Rare)
- Peak: Unlock all 3 dynasties, breed first hybrid
- Ongoing: Pursuit of 100% collection

**Fractal Structure:**
1. **Overall Game:** Intro → Unlock dynasties → Complete collection
2. **Each Session:** First round → Build momentum → Energy depletion
3. **Each Round:** Start → Speed up → High-speed climax → Death/completion

## Interest Threshold - When Players Quit

**Threshold Crossing:** Player interest drops below "worth continuing"
**SupaSnake Prevention:**
- Energy system creates natural stop point before boredom
- Parallelism: Tired of Classic? Try breeding
- Quick sessions prevent interest from declining (Emma quits at peak, not trough)

## Pacing for Mobile Sessions

**Emma (Commuter - 5-10 min):**
- Needs: Fast hook, quick climax, satisfying resolution
- Curve: Steep ramp to peak, short cooldown
- Energy gates perfect session length (5-7 rounds ≈ 8 minutes)

**Tyler (Grinder - 60+ min):**
- Needs: Long-term goals visible, deeper progression
- Curve: Gradual build across multiple sessions
- Collection completion provides extended interest (weeks of play)

## Avoiding Bad Curves

**Problem: Flat middle** (Aladdin Magic Carpet example)
- Solution: Cut boring section OR add shortcut
- SupaSnake: If rounds 3-4 feel flat, increase spawn rate or introduce power-up

**Problem: Peak too early**
- Solution: Reorder content (put best moment last)
- SupaSnake: Save legendary spawns for high-speed late rounds

**Problem: No hook**
- Solution: Start exciting (Tutorial Trap avoided - jump straight to gameplay)
- SupaSnake: Round 1 gives immediate DNA collection satisfaction
