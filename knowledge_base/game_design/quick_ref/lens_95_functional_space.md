# Lens #95: The Lens of Functional Space - Quick Reference

**Source**: The Art of Game Design (Schell), Chapter 19

## The Lens

**Focus**: How does the game space serve gameplay functions?

**Ask Yourself:**
- Is game space just decoration or does it enhance gameplay?
- How does space organization support player goals?
- What does the space communicate about what players should do?
- Are there dead areas that serve no function?

## Core Principle

Game worlds should be **functional, not just decorative**. Every area, visual element, and spatial decision should serve gameplay, communicate meaning, or enhance player experience.

## SupaSnake Application

**Lab Spaces as Functional Areas:**

**Evolution Lab (Gameplay):**
- **Function**: Core snake gameplay zone
- **Visual Communication**: Arena-like, central focus on snake
- **Gameplay Support**: Clear play area, score/stats visible, energy consumption shown
- **Emotional Tone**: Energetic, active, focused

**Breeding Lab (Discovery):**
- **Function**: Experimentation and pursuit zone
- **Visual Communication**: Two parent slots + result preview
- **Gameplay Support**: Shows inheritance, DNA costs, generation tracking
- **Emotional Tone**: Curious, hopeful, strategic

**Collection Lab (Achievement):**
- **Function**: Progress tracking and trophy display
- **Visual Communication**: Gallery grid, completion indicators
- **Gameplay Support**: Shows missing variants, rarity tiers, dynasty organization
- **Emotional Tone**: Pride, accomplishment, aspiration

**Dynasty-Specific Backgrounds:**

Each lab has three visual variants (one per dynasty) that serve functional purpose:

**CYBER Lab:**
- **Visual**: Digital grid, circuit patterns, data streams
- **Function**: Reinforces tech dynasty identity when viewing CYBER variants
- **Communication**: "You are in the digital realm"
- **Avoid**: Generic backgrounds that could be any dynasty

**PRIMAL Lab:**
- **Visual**: Cave walls, jungle vines, tribal carvings
- **Function**: Reinforces nature dynasty identity
- **Communication**: "You are in the ancient world"
- **Avoid**: Modern/clean aesthetics that break immersion

**COSMIC Lab:**
- **Visual**: Starfield, nebulae, ethereal glow
- **Function**: Reinforces space/mystical dynasty identity
- **Communication**: "You are in the cosmic realm"
- **Avoid**: Grounded/terrestrial visuals that feel mundane

## Functional Space Checklist

**For Each Screen/Lab:**

✅ **Clear Purpose**: Player knows what to do here
- Evolution Lab → Play snake game
- Breeding Lab → Breed variants
- Collection Lab → View collection

✅ **Visual Hierarchy**: Most important elements most prominent
- Active variant is largest element
- Score/stats clearly visible
- Secondary info recedes visually

✅ **Navigation Support**: Easy to understand how to move between areas
- Tab icons at bottom (clear lab switching)
- Back buttons consistent
- Current location obvious

✅ **Functional Details**: Every visual element serves purpose
- Dynasty background → reinforces world identity
- Empty variant slots → show collection gaps (motivate pursuit)
- Completion % → track progress (achievement feedback)

❌ **Avoid Non-Functional Elements**:
- Decorative UI that obscures gameplay
- Confusing layouts that hide important info
- Unnecessary animations that delay player actions
- Generic visuals that don't communicate dynasty

## Design Questions

**Space Organization:**
- What is this screen's primary function?
- What should player focus on first?
- How does layout support player goals?
- Are there wasted areas that serve no purpose?

**Visual Communication:**
- Do visuals communicate what to do here?
- Does dynasty background reinforce current context?
- Are interactive elements obvious?
- Can player parse screen in 2 seconds?

**Gameplay Support:**
- Does layout make core actions easy?
- Are important stats/info always visible?
- Can player accomplish goals without confusion?
- Does space enhance or hinder gameplay?

## Examples

**Good Functional Space - Breeding Lab:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  BREEDING LAB                       │
│  ┌─────────┐   +   ┌─────────┐     │ ← Clear parent slots
│  │ Parent 1│       │ Parent 2│     │
│  └─────────┘       └─────────┘     │
│         ↓                           │ ← Visual flow
│    ┌─────────┐                      │
│    │  Child  │  ← 500 DNA          │ ← Result preview + cost
│    │ Preview │                      │
│    └─────────┘                      │
│    [BREED BUTTON]                   │ ← Clear action
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
Dynasty background: CYBER (if parents are CYBER)
```

**Function**: Everything visible serves breeding workflow
- Parent selection obvious
- Cost clearly shown before commitment
- Result preview reduces uncertainty
- Single action button (can't get confused)
- Background reinforces dynasty context

**Poor Functional Space:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  COOL SNAKE ZONE!!! 🐍🔥            │ ← Unclear purpose
│  [Random decoration]  [Stats?]      │ ← Confusing elements
│  Parent: ??? Child: ???             │ ← Hidden important info
│  [BREED] [CANCEL] [INFO] [HELP]    │ ← Too many buttons
│  [Decorative animation playing]     │ ← Blocks interaction
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
Generic background (no dynasty reinforcement)
```

**Problems**: Space doesn't communicate purpose or support workflow

## Quick Facts

- **Form Follows Function**: Design spaces for gameplay first, aesthetics second
- **Every Element Earns Its Place**: If it doesn't serve function, remove it
- **Visual = Functional Communication**: How space looks should explain what it does
- **Dynasty Backgrounds**: Not decoration - they reinforce world identity (functional)

## Common Pitfalls

- Over-decorating UI at expense of clarity
- Creating "pretty but confusing" layouts
- Adding visual noise that hides important info
- Using generic backgrounds that don't reinforce dynasty identity
- Making players hunt for critical information
