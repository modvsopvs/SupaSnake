# Lens #81: The Lens of Community

## The Question

## Key Questions

- Do players with shared interests find each other?
- Can communities form organically?
- Are there identity anchors (dynasties, guilds)?

**Positive Culture**
- Does the game reward positive behavior?
- Are toxic behaviors discouraged by design?
- Can community self-moderate?
- Do players celebrate each other's success?

**Meaningful Interaction**
- Do players have interesting things to discuss?
- Are there memorable moments to share?
- Can players help each other meaningfully?
- Is there depth for expert communities?

**Accessibility**
- Can new players enter the community?
- Are veterans welcoming?
- Multiple entry points (casual, competitive, creative)?
- Language/cultural barriers addressed?
