## Core Concept

Effective brainstorming isn't just "thinking of ideas"—it's a disciplined creative practice with specific techniques that multiply output. The best ideas rarely come from staring at blank paper; they come from environmental setup, visual thinking, perspective shifts, and quantity over quality.

## Top 7 Techniques (from Schell's 15)

**1. Pictures Beat Words**
Draw crude sketches of ideas—visual memory triggers more ideas than text. Doesn't require artistic skill. Drawing = thinking.

**2. Toys and Physical Objects**
Bring toys related (and unrelated!) to your problem. Visual/tactile stimulation sparks connections. Clay/Play-Doh for sculpting ideas.

**3. Change Perspective**
Brainstorm standing, sitting, walking, at different locations. Physical perspective shifts mental perspective. "Things look different from up here."

**4. Write Everything**
Don't censor—stupid ideas clear the way for brilliant ones. Write down EVERY idea, even terrible ones. Number your lists (gives dignity to items).

**5. Mix and Match Categories**
Make separate lists for Technology/Mechanics/Story/Aesthetics (tetrad), then combine: "Cell phone" + "Tetris-like" + "Hospital theme" + "Anime style" = new idea.

**6. The Space Remembers**
Put ideas on walls—spatial memory stronger than list memory. Weeks later, walk back in and resume as if never stopped.

**7. Spare No Expense**
Never let materials constrain creativity. Use good pens, big paper, one side only. Process needs dignity. Finding million-dollar ideas—don't let pennies block them.

## Application to SupaSnake

**Pictures:** Sketch Collection Lab layouts, draw snake movement patterns, visualize breeding trees
**Toys:** Get snake toys, Panini sticker books, breeding game pieces—fiddle with them while thinking
**Perspective:** Brainstorm while playing mobile games, watching others play, at playground (target audience)
**Write Everything:** "Snakes with wings," "DNA farming mini-game," "Social trading"—don't filter yet
**Mix/Match:** Platform (mobile) + Mechanic (breeding) + Story (dynasty legacy) + Aesthetic (minimalist) = ?
**Space:** Dedicated wall for SupaSnake design—Collection Lab on left, Core Snake on right, integrations in middle
**Expense:** Buy premium brainstorming notebook, large Post-Its, good markers—respect the process

## When to Use

- **Stuck on a design problem:** Change perspective physically
- **Need many options:** Write everything, aim for 50+ ideas
- **Refining a system:** Mix and match categories to find new combinations
- **Team design:** Use wall space for group visibility
