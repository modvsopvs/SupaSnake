# App Store Presence & Discoverability - Quick Reference

**Source**: Schell Ch. 30 "The Game Needs an Audience", Ch. 31 "The Pitch"

## Core Principle

**Your game is invisible until discovered.** App Store Optimization (ASO) is SEO for mobile—get found in search, featured in charts, and convert views to downloads.

## The Discoverability Problem

### Mobile App Store Reality (2024)

**Competition**:
- iOS App Store: 1.8 million apps
- Google Play: 2.5 million apps
- New games daily: ~1,000 iOS, ~2,000 Android
- **Featured spots**: <100 per week globally

**Discovery methods**:
1. **Search** (65% of downloads) - User knows what they want
2. **Browse/Charts** (25%) - User exploring categories
3. **Featured/Editorial** (10%) - Curated by Apple/Google
4. **External** (<5%) - Social media, press, word-of-mouth

**Implication**: If you're not in top 100 search results or top charts, you're invisible.

### The "First Impression" Challenge

**User decision flow**:
1. See app icon in search results (0.5 seconds)
2. Read app name + subtitle (2 seconds)
3. Glance at screenshots (5 seconds)
4. Check ratings + download count (2 seconds)
5. **Decision**: Download or scroll past (total: <10 seconds)

**SupaSnake challenge**: Communicate "breeding + collecting + Snake" in 10 seconds with no words.

## App Store Optimization (ASO) Elements

### 1. App Name (Critical Weight)

**Format**: [Brand Name] - [Subtitle Keywords]

**SupaSnake options**:
- ❌ "SupaSnake" (no keywords, searchability poor)
- ✅ "SupaSnake - Snake Breeding Game" (brand + keywords)
- ✅ "SupaSnake: Collect & Evolve Snakes" (action verbs + collectible appeal)

**Rules**:
- iOS: 30 characters max for name
- Subtitle: 30 characters (appears in search)
- **Keywords matter**: "Snake", "Breeding", "Collection", "Casual"

**Research**: Search "snake game" → What names rank? Copy patterns.

### 2. App Icon (First Visual)

**Function**: Instant brand recognition + category signal

**SupaSnake icon requirements**:
- **Recognizable**: Snake shape immediately clear at 60x60pt
- **Distinct**: Doesn't look like generic snake game (#437 in search)
- **Colorful**: Pops against white background (App Store) and dark (home screen)
- **Simple**: No text, no clutter (illegible at small size)

**Design approach**:
- Snake head (not full body) - iconic, simple
- Gradient scales (visual interest, "genetic diversity" hint)
- Vibrant color (not green like every other snake game)

**Testing**: Place icon next to Candy Crush, Subway Surfers, Fruit Ninja → Does it compete visually?

### 3. Screenshots (Conversion Driver)

**Layout** (iOS/Android):
- First 2 screenshots visible without scrolling (CRITICAL)
- Portrait orientation: 3 visible in App Store
- **User spends 5 seconds here** → Make them count

**SupaSnake screenshot strategy**:

**Screenshot 1: Hero Shot**
- Classic Snake gameplay (instantly recognizable genre)
- Overlaid text: "Classic Snake, Reimagined"
- UI visible: Energy, score, clean design

**Screenshot 2: Unique Value Prop**
- Breeding Lab UI with two parent snakes + egg
- Text: "Breed & Collect Unique Snakes"
- Show genetics in action (not just claim)

**Screenshot 3: Progression Hook**
- Collection Lab showing incomplete dynasty (5/15 variants)
- Text: "Complete 3 Dynasties"
- Taps into "gotta catch 'em all" psychology

**Screenshot 4: Social Proof**
- High score leaderboard (if real data)
- OR testimonials (if reviews)
- Text: "Compete with Friends"

**Screenshot 5: Endgame Tease**
- Rare legendary variant (glowing, cool design)
- Text: "Discover Legendary Snakes"
- Creates aspiration

**Design rules**:
- Large, clear UI (readable at thumbnail size)
- Text overlays (don't assume user understands gameplay)
- Action shots (not static menus)
- Before/after (show progression)

### 4. App Description

**Structure**:
- **First 3 lines**: Visible without "Read More" (CRITICAL)
- **Next 5-10 lines**: Feature list (bullets)
- **Rest**: Keywords, social proof, calls-to-action

**SupaSnake description**:

```

**Keyword strategy**: Natural language > keyword stuffing (2024 algorithms detect spam)

### 5. App Preview Video (Optional, High Impact)

**Format**: 15-30 second video auto-plays in App Store

**SupaSnake video script** (30 sec):
- 0-5s: Classic Snake gameplay (familiarity)
- 5-10s: Snake reaches goal, egg appears (reward)
- 10-15s: Breeding Lab, combine two snakes (unique mechanic)
- 15-20s: New variant hatches, added to collection (progression)
- 20-25s: Montage of 8-10 different snake variants (variety)
- 25-30s: Logo + "Download Free" CTA

**Production**: Capture actual gameplay (not cinematic trailer) → Authenticity converts better.

### 6. Ratings & Reviews (Social Proof)

**Impact**: 4.5+ stars = credible, <4.0 stars = red flag

**SupaSnake strategy**:
- Prompt for review after first successful breed (positive moment)
- Timing: Day 7 (retained players, not drive-bys)
- Incentive: None (Apple prohibits incentivized reviews)
- Response: Reply to all reviews (shows developer cares)

**Review optimization**:
- Fix critical bugs fast (prevent 1-star reviews)
- Add requested features (turn reviewers into advocates)
- Highlight positive reviews in marketing

### 7. Localization (Global Reach)

**Minimum**: English (US, UK, Australia, Canada, India)
**Tier 2**: Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Chinese (Simplified)
**Impact**: 2-5x downloads in localized markets

**SupaSnake approach** (Phase 1):
- English only (MVP)
- Use universal visual language (icons, not text)
- Plan for localization (externalize strings, no hardcoded text)

**Phase 2**: Spanish + French (largest ROI for indie)

## App Store Algorithm Factors

### Keyword Ranking

**How it works**: App Store indexes your app for keywords in:
1. App name + subtitle (highest weight)
2. Keyword field (iOS: 100 characters, important)
3. Description (lower weight, but still indexed)

**SupaSnake keyword strategy**:

**Primary keywords** (high volume, high relevance):
- "snake game"
- "breeding game"
- "collection game"
- "casual game"

**Secondary keywords** (lower volume, less competition):
- "snake evolution"
- "genetics game"
- "dynasty game"
- "snake variants"

**Long-tail keywords** (niche, high conversion):
- "snake breeding collect"
- "pokemon like snake"
- "casual snake arcade"

**Tool**: App Annie, Sensor Tower (keyword research)

### Download Velocity

**How it works**: Apps with high download rate in first 72 hours rank higher

**SupaSnake launch strategy**:
1. **Pre-launch**: Build email list (100-500 early testers)
2. **Day 1**: Email blast + social media → Spike downloads
3. **Days 2-3**: Momentum carries into "New Games We Love" consideration
4. **Week 1**: If featured, ride wave; if not, iterate ASO

**Goal**: 100+ downloads Day 1 (signals to algorithm app is worth showing)

### Retention & Engagement

**How it works**: App Store tracks Day 1, Day 7, Day 30 retention → High retention = featured

**SupaSnake retention drivers**:
- Day 1: Energy refill (bring them back in 5 hours)
- Day 7: First rare breed (achievement unlocked)
- Day 30: 50% collection complete (endgame visible)

**Metrics to hit**:
- Day 1 retention: 35%+ (industry avg 25%)
- Day 7 retention: 15%+ (industry avg 10%)
- Day 30 retention: 5%+ (industry avg 3%)

## The "Featured" Path (Apple Editorial)

### What Apple Looks For

**Quality criteria**:
1. **Visual polish**: High-quality assets, no placeholder art
2. **Originality**: Unique twist (breeding + Snake = novel)
3. **Performance**: No crashes, 60fps smooth
4. **Accessibility**: VoiceOver support, color blindness modes
5. **Topical**: Ties to events (Snake Day? Retro gaming trend?)

**SupaSnake chances**: Moderate (original concept, but indie unknown)

### How to Pitch for Featuring

**Process**:
1. Build relationship with App Store editors (email, Twitter)
2. Submit "App Store Pitch" in App Store Connect
3. Highlight unique angle: "Classic Snake meets Pokémon breeding"
4. Show press coverage, influencer buzz (social proof)
5. Offer exclusive first look (build goodwill)

**Timeline**: Pitch 4-6 weeks before launch (editors plan monthly)

**Realistic expectation**: 5-10% chance for indie first game → Don't rely on it, but worth trying.

## Marketing Beyond the App Store

### Soft Launch Strategy

**Purpose**: Test ASO, gameplay, monetization in small market before global launch

**SupaSnake plan**:
1. Launch in Canada or Philippines (English-speaking, smaller market)
2. Run for 2-4 weeks
3. Measure: Retention, conversion, ASO performance
4. Iterate: Fix bugs, adjust energy balance, refine screenshots
5. Global launch: With proven metrics

**Benefit**: Fix mistakes before US/global audience sees them

### Influencer Marketing (Indie Budget)

**Approach**: Micro-influencers (10k-100k followers) > Mega-influencers

**SupaSnake strategy**:
1. Identify: Casual mobile game streamers, retro gaming YouTubers
2. Reach out: Free early access, not paid sponsorship (indie budget)
3. Pitch: "Remember Snake? Check out this breeding twist"
4. Deliverable: Honest review video (not scripted ad)

**Cost**: $0 (early access) to $500 (micro-influencer sponsorship)
**ROI**: 1 video (50k views) = ~500-2,000 downloads

### Social Media Presence

**Platforms**:
- **Twitter/X**: Game dev updates, behind-the-scenes
- **TikTok**: 15s gameplay clips (breeding reveals, rare variants)
- **Reddit**: r/AndroidGaming, r/iOSGaming (soft pitches, not spam)
- **Discord**: Community server (super fans, beta testers)

**SupaSnake content strategy**:
- Daily: Gameplay GIFs (breeding combinations)
- Weekly: Dev update (what's coming next)
- Monthly: Community challenges (breed X snake, win cosmetic)

**Goal**: Build 500-1,000 engaged fans pre-launch (mailing list, Discord)

## Metrics to Track

**ASO Performance**:
- Keyword rankings (target: top 10 for "snake game breeding")
- Search impressions → downloads (target: 10%+ conversion)
- Screenshot views → downloads (target: 30%+ conversion)

**Discovery Sources**:
