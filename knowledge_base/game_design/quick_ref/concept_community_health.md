# Community Health - Quick Reference

**Context**: Healthy mobile game communities are self-sustaining, positive, and create content that attracts new players.

## Health Indicators

**Positive Signs**:
- **User-Generated Content** - Breeding guides, fan art, strategy videos
- **Organic Moderation** - Experienced players help newcomers without prompting
- **Constructive Feedback** - Players suggest features respectfully
- **Event Participation** - High turnout for limited-time breeding events
- **Knowledge Sharing** - Openly shared breeding formulas, not hoarded

**Warning Signs**:
- **Toxicity** - Elitism ("You don't have X variant? Casual."), gatekeeping
- **Dead Silence** - No posts for days, announcements ignored
- **Spam/Off-Topic** - Community loses focus on game
- **Mod Burnout** - Solo dev doing all moderation work
- **Pay-to-Win Complaints** - DNA pricing seen as exploitative

## Solo Dev Health Maintenance

**Lightweight Moderation** (1-2 hours/week):
- Set clear community rules (no trading real money, be respectful)
- Empower 2-3 volunteer moderators from founding players
- Use Discord AutoMod for spam/links
- Weekly community spotlight post (best breeding tip, rare pull showcase)

**Prevent Burnout**:
- Don't promise features in community (creates obligation)
- Batch community engagement (one Discord session per day)
- Automate announcements (patch notes auto-post via webhook)
- Say "no" to unreasonable requests gracefully

**Foster Positivity**:
- Celebrate player achievements (first rare pull, completed collection)
- Feature player guides in official channels
- Monthly "Player of the Month" recognition
- Developer transparency about roadmap (but no promises)

## Metrics Dashboard (5-Minute Weekly Check)

```
Community Health Scorecard:
✓ Discord messages/week: [Target: 200+]
✓ New guide posts/month: [Target: 2+]
✓ Moderator actions/week: [Target: <5 = healthy, >20 = toxic]
✓ Player-reported bugs/week: [Target: 3-10 = engaged but not broken]
✓ Positive sentiment ratio: [Target: 80%+ positive/neutral]
```

## Crisis Patterns

**Nerf Backlash**:
- Community explodes when rare variant nerfed
- Response: Acknowledge, explain reasoning, offer compensation (DNA refund)

**Exploit Discovery**:
- Players find infinite DNA bug, community debates ethics
- Response: Fix fast, thank reporters, don't punish exploiters retroactively

**Content Drought**:
- No new dynasties for 3+ months, community stagnates
- Response: Tease roadmap, release small variant update, run event
