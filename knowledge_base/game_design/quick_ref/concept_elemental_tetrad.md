# Elemental Tetrad - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (2008), Chapter 4

## Core Concept

Every game comprises four equally essential elements forming the "elemental tetrad": **Mechanics** (rules/procedures), **Story** (event sequences), **Aesthetics** (look/sound/feel), and **Technology** (enabling materials/systems). None is more important—each powerfully influences the others. Great games harmonize all four elements toward a unified player experience.

## Key Points

- **Mechanics:** Rules, goals, procedures—what makes a game a game (unique to games vs. linear media)
- **Story:** Event sequences (linear or emergent) that unfold through play
- **Aesthetics:** Sensory experiences—visuals, audio, feel—most directly affecting player experience
- **Technology:** Materials/systems enabling the game (paper, plastic, lasers, mobile hardware)
- **Visibility Gradient:** Technology least visible to players, aesthetics most visible, mechanics/story middle
- **Equal Importance Principle:** Designers favor mechanics, artists favor aesthetics, engineers favor tech, writers favor story—but all are your domain

## Application to SupaSnake

**Mechanics:** Match-3 snake movement, breeding genetics, energy gates, DNA economy
**Story:** Dynasty narratives (mythical origins), player's collection journey, emergent breeding stories ("I created the perfect Glacier snake!")
**Aesthetics:** Colorful mobile-optimized art, satisfying breeding animations, audio feedback, haptics on variant reveals
**Technology:** React Native enabling iOS/Android, Supabase backend, real-time multiplayer infrastructure (future)

**Harmony Example:** Glacier Dynasty's **icy blue aesthetics** reinforce **cold-themed story**, enabled by **mobile graphics tech**, supporting **speed-reduction mechanics** that create strategic gameplay variations.

## Modern Context

**2008 Context:** Tetrad discussed primarily for console/PC games with clear tech boundaries
**2025 Mobile:** Technology element dramatically shapes other three—touch controls demand different mechanics, small screens demand bold aesthetics, interrupted play demands episodic story. SupaSnake's session-based energy (technology constraint) drives breeding focus (mechanics), collection satisfaction (aesthetics), and generational narratives (story).
