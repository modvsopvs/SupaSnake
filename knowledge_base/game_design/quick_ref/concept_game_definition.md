# Game Definition - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (2008), Chapter 3

## Core Concept

Schell defines a game as "a problem-solving activity, approached with a playful attitude." This elegant definition distills ten complex qualities into a simple framework: games present problems for players to solve, but the defining element is the player's willful, curious, playful engagement—not obligation.

## Key Points

- **Ten Qualities of Games:** Entered willfully, have goals, contain conflict, have rules, can be won/lost, are interactive, have challenge, create internal value, engage players, are closed formal systems
- **Problem-Solving Core:** Every game presents problems (reach the goal, defeat opponents, complete the level, win the match)
- **Playful Attitude Distinction:** Same activity can be work or play depending on motivation—Rico's factory work became play when he competed against his own records
- **The Magic Circle:** Games create internal mental spaces (closed formal systems) where simplified versions of reality allow focused problem-solving with endogenous meaning

## Application to SupaSnake

SupaSnake exemplifies this definition: **Problem:** "Can I breed the perfect snake?" **Playful Approach:** Collection-driven curiosity, not obligation. Players enter willfully, face breeding challenges (conflict), follow game rules, win by completing collections, create internal value (rare variants matter inside the game), and stay engaged through emergent problems (new dynasties monthly).

**Modern Context:** Mobile F2P amplifies playful attitude requirement—players abandon games instantly if fun disappears. SupaSnake's energy system preserves playfulness by preventing grind-based obligation.
