# Motivation Foundations - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (3rd Edition, 2020), Chapters 9-10

## Core Concept

Players are motivated by pleasures (psychographics) more than demographics. Understanding what pleasures different player types seek—and designing to satisfy multiple pleasure preferences simultaneously—creates inclusive games that appeal to broader audiences.

## Key Frameworks

**LeBlanc's 8 Game Pleasures:**
1. **Sensation** - Seeing beauty, hearing music, tactile joy
2. **Fantasy** - Imagining yourself as something you're not
3. **Narrative** - Dramatic unfolding of events
4. **Challenge** - Problems to solve, mastery to achieve
5. **Fellowship** - Friendship, cooperation, community
6. **Discovery** - Finding new things, exploring, secrets
7. **Expression** - Creating, designing, self-expression
8. **Submission** - Entering magic circle, leaving real world behind

**Bartle's 4 Player Types:**
1. ♦ **Achievers** - Want to achieve goals (pleasure: challenge)
2. ♠ **Explorers** - Want to discover breadth (pleasure: discovery)
3. ♥ **Socializers** - Want relationships (pleasure: fellowship)
4. ♣ **Killers** - Want to compete/defeat (pleasure: competition/destruction)

## Additional Pleasures

- **Anticipation** - Waiting for known pleasure
- **Completion** - Finishing something (collect all, clear level)
- **Pride/Naches** - Satisfaction in accomplishment
- **Triumph/Fiero** - Overcoming long-shot odds
- **Possibility** - Having many choices available

## Application to SupaSnake

**Emma's Pleasure Profile (Casual):**

**Primary Pleasures:**
1. **Submission** - Escaping work stress into nostalgic Snake game
2. **Completion** - Filling Panini book sections (deeply satisfying)
3. **Anticipation** - "Energy refills in 15 minutes" (something to look forward to)
4. **Sensation** - Beautiful variant reveals, smooth Snake controls

**Bartle Type:** Light Achiever (completes easy collections) + light Explorer (discovers common variants)

**Design Serves:** Simple collection paths, visible progress bars, energy anticipation, polished aesthetics.

**Tyler's Pleasure Profile (Hardcore):**

**Primary Pleasures:**
1. **Discovery** - Finding hidden breeding combos, rare 0.1% variants
2. **Challenge** - Mastering Snake mechanics, optimizing breeding
3. **Triumph/Fiero** - "YES! Got the legendary after 50 tries!"
4. **Pride/Naches** - Showing 100% collection to friends

**Bartle Type:** Strong Achiever (100% completion) + strong Explorer (discover all secrets) + some Killer (leaderboard competition)

**Design Serves:** Deep breeding system, rare variants, hidden combos, leaderboards, completion achievements.

**Multi-Demographic Design:** SupaSnake provides pleasure buffet—different players take different pleasures from same systems:
- Emma: Completion pleasure from Panini UI
- Tyler: Discovery pleasure from breeding depth
- Both satisfied without forcing either into unwanted pleasure types

## Gender Stereotype Insights (Schell's Findings)

**Male-Associated Pleasures:**
- Mastery (for its own sake)
- Competition (proving superiority)
- Destruction (virtual mayhem)
- Spatial puzzles (3D navigation)
- Trial-and-error learning

**Female-Associated Pleasures:**
- Emotion (exploring feelings)
- Real-world connection (meaningful simulation)
- Nurturing (caring for creatures)
- Verbal puzzles (word games)
- Learning by example (clear tutorials)

**SupaSnake Gender Balance:**
- **Male Appeal:** Snake mastery, breeding optimization, leaderboard competition, strategic depth
- **Female Appeal:** Nurturing dynasties (breeding = caring), collection completion, accessible gameplay, clear tutorials
- **Inclusive Design:** BOTH paths equally rewarding (Pirates of Caribbean lesson—support offensive AND defensive play)

## Modern Mobile Context (2020)

**3rd Edition (2020):** Women and men now play digital games in roughly equal numbers. Social features (friends lists in online games) connect to real-world relationships—increasing female engagement.

**SupaSnake Specific:**
- v0.1: Single-player (appeals to Achievers, Explorers)
- v0.5: Social features (friends, trading—appeals to Socializers, especially females)
- Breeding = nurturing (female-associated pleasure)
- Leaderboards = competition (male-associated pleasure)
- BOTH optional—players self-select into preferred pleasures
