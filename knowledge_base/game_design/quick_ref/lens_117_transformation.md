# Lens #117: Transformation - Quick Reference

**Source:** Schell, Chapter 33 "The Designer Changes the Player"

## The Lens

**To use this lens, ask yourself:**

- How is the player changing as they play my game?
- How is the player changing after they play my game?
- Are these changes positive or negative?
- Do I take responsibility for these changes?
- Should I try to change how the player changes?

## Purpose

**This lens reminds you that games transform players** - and you must consciously design those transformations.

## Application to SupaSnake

**During Play Changes:**
- **Skill Development:** Learning breeding mechanics, DNA optimization, collection strategy
- **Emotional States:** Flow during Snake gameplay, excitement during rare breeding success
- **Strategic Thinking:** Planning multi-generation breeding chains
- **Social Connection:** Sharing strategies, competing on leaderboards

**After Play Changes:**
- **Strategic Mindset:** Emma applies resource management thinking to real life
- **Community Connection:** Tyler made friends through SupaSnake Discord
- **Appreciation for Depth:** Casual players discover they enjoy strategic mobile games
- **Probability Understanding:** Breeding mechanics make genetics intuitive

**Are Changes Positive?**
- ✅ Yes: Skills learned, connections formed, joy experienced
- ❌ To avoid: Addiction, financial harm, social isolation, anxiety

**Taking Responsibility:**
- Energy system prevents unhealthy play patterns
- Transparent probabilities = informed decisions
- No dark patterns = respecting player agency
- Community moderation = safe social space

**Should I Change How Players Change?**
- Current: Good transformations (strategic thinking, community)
- Opportunity: Add tutorial path that teaches breeding more explicitly
- Warning: Watch for players grinding instead of enjoying - adjust if needed

## Design Questions

**What skills are players learning?**
- Resource management (DNA economy)
- Strategic planning (breeding chains)
- Probability assessment (breeding outcomes)
- Collection curation (quality vs. completion)

**What emotions are players experiencing?**
- Joy (successful breeding, completing collections)
- Excitement (competing on leaderboards)
- Delight (surprise rare variants)
- Satisfaction (mastering mechanics)

**What behaviors am I encouraging?**
- Strategic thinking (planning ahead)
- Community participation (sharing discoveries)
- Skill development (improving at Snake)
- Thoughtful spending (energy as pacing, not pressure)

**What behaviors am I discouraging?**
- Mindless grinding (fun core loop prevents)
- Excessive spending (energy cap limits)
- Toxic competition (friend leaderboards, no P2W)
- Burnout (natural stopping points)

## Red Flags

**Stop and redesign if players are:**
- Developing unhealthy play patterns
- Experiencing anxiety or stress
- Feeling manipulated or exploited
- Harming themselves financially
- Becoming isolated from real connections
