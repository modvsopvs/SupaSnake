# Designer Responsibility - Quick Reference

**Source:** Schell, Chapter 34 "Responsibility"

## Core Idea

**Designers have outsized influence** on players' lives. Great games can transform millions of people. With that power comes profound responsibility.

## Spheres of Responsibility

**To Players:**
- Create positive experiences
- Respect their time, money, and well-being
- Protect vulnerable users (children, addiction-prone)
- Build safe, welcoming communities
- Be honest in all communication

**To Team:**
- Treat team members with respect
- Create sustainable work culture (no crunch)
- Give credit where due
- Make decisions collaboratively
- Support professional growth

**To Society:**
- Consider cultural impact of your work
- Avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes
- Use influence to make world better, not worse
- Think about unintended consequences
- Take criticism seriously and respond

**To Yourself:**
- Maintain integrity and values
- Work on projects you're proud of
- Develop skills continuously
- Balance work and life
- Stay physically and mentally healthy

## SupaSnake Responsibilities

**To Players:**
- **No Dark Patterns:** Transparent, ethical F2P
- **Positive Community:** Moderation, no toxic competition
- **Mental Health:** Energy caps prevent unhealthy play
- **Accessibility:** Simple controls, colorblind modes
- **Honesty:** Accurate marketing, transparent odds

**To Solo Dev (Myself):**
- **Sustainable Scope:** Build what I can maintain alone
- **Skill Development:** Learn React Native, mobile F2P, game design
- **Portfolio Quality:** Ship something I'm proud to show
- **Work-Life Balance:** No burnout, sustainable pace
- **Ethics First:** Never compromise values for profit

**To Future Team:**
- **Clean Codebase:** Well-documented, maintainable
- **Ethical Foundation:** Easy to build on without moral compromise
- **Scalable Systems:** Designed for eventual team growth
- **Community Asset:** Already positive, supportive player base

**To Mobile Gaming:**
- **Show Ethical F2P Works:** Prove you can be profitable AND respectful
- **Raise Standards:** Demonstrate what ethical mobile looks like
- **Inspire Others:** Open-source learnings, mentor new devs eventually

## Practical Responsibility Checks

**Before Every Design Decision:**
1. Is this good for players?
2. Is this honest and transparent?
3. Would I be proud to defend this publicly?
4. Does this align with my values?
5. Am I respecting my own limits?

**If any answer is "no," reconsider the decision.**

## Common Responsibility Failures

**Industry Examples to Avoid:**
- Loot boxes targeting children
- Predatory monetization (whaling)
- Crunch culture burning out teams
- Toxic communities left unmoderated
- Deceptive marketing
- Exploiting psychological vulnerabilities

**SupaSnake Commitments:**
- No loot boxes (transparent breeding probabilities)
- Spending caps (energy system limits whaling)
- Sustainable solo dev pace (no crunch)
- Planned community moderation
- Honest marketing (actual gameplay)
- Ethical psychology (flow, not addiction)

## The Long View

**Ask Yourself:**
- In 10 years, will I be proud of this game?
- What legacy am I creating?
- How are players' lives different because of my work?
- Did I make the world slightly better?

**SupaSnake's Intended Legacy:**
- Proof ethical F2P mobile games can succeed
- Players who learned strategic thinking while having fun
- Community that felt welcoming and positive
- Other indie devs inspired to build ethically
