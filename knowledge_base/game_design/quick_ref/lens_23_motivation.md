# Lens #23: The Lens of Motivation

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (3rd Edition, 2020), Chapter 11

## The Lens

Every game is a complex ecosystem of motivations. To examine them more closely, ask yourself these questions:

- **What motivations do players have to play my game?**
- **Which motivations are most internal? Which are most external?**
- **Which are pleasure-seeking? Which are pain-avoiding?**
- **Which motivations support each other?**
- **Which motivations are in conflict?**

## Core Insight

Motivation is complex—not binary (intrinsic/extrinsic) but a 2D matrix (internal/external × wanna/hafta). Different motivations can amplify or undermine each other. Pain-avoidance motivations (daily login obligations) feel different from pleasure-seeking (exciting discoveries) even at same intensity.

## Application to SupaSnake

**Motivation Inventory:**

**Internal + Wanna (Strongest):**
- Snake mastery enjoyment (Tyler's flow state)
- Breeding discovery curiosity
- Personal record pride

**Internal + Hafta:**
- Perfectionism pressure (must complete full set)
- Self-imposed daily goals (Emma's collection targets)

**External + Wanna:**
- DNA rewards for good runs (extrinsic but fun)
- Unlocking new variants (pleasure-seeking)
- Clan bonuses (social reward)

**External + Hafta:**
- Energy timers ("must play before it caps")
- Daily refill deadlines ("use it or lose it")
- Clan obligations (don't let team down)

**Supporting Pairs:**
- Snake mastery (internal wanna) + DNA rewards (external wanna) = Synergy
- Collection completion (internal hafta) + Set bonuses (external wanna) = Progression feeling
- Breeding curiosity (internal wanna) + Rare variant discovery (external wanna) = Reinforcing

**Conflicting Pairs:**
- Energy scarcity vs Snake flow = Tension (mitigated by generous F2P energy)
- Daily obligations vs Voluntary play = F2P trap risk (avoided via no penalties)
- Clan pressure vs Personal pace = Social burden (reduced by optional clans)

**SupaSnake Resolution:** Reduce conflicts (no penalties, generous energy), amplify supports (DNA scales with skill, perfect runs get 2× DNA).
