# Dark Patterns in Games - Quick Reference

**Source:** Schell, Chapter 34 "Responsibility" + industry analysis

## Definition

**Dark patterns** are design tricks that manipulate players into actions against their best interests - usually spending money or time they didn't intend to.

## Common Dark Patterns (AVOID ALL)

**1. Hidden Costs:**
- Unclear pricing structures
- Premium currency obfuscation
- Surprise charges after commitment
- **SupaSnake:** Energy prices always clear upfront

**2. FOMO (Fear of Missing Out):**
- Limited-time offers creating urgency
- Daily login rewards punishing breaks
- "Miss this and regret forever" messaging
- **SupaSnake:** No time-limited content, play at your pace

**3. Predatory Loot Boxes:**
- Unknown contents before purchase
- Extremely low odds for valuable items
- "Just one more try" psychology
- **SupaSnake:** Breeding shows exact probabilities, no blind purchases

**4. Pay-to-Win:**
- Competitive advantage sold for money
- Impossible to compete without spending
- Escalating arms race of spending
- **SupaSnake:** Classic Mode leaderboard is pure skill (free)

**5. Grinding:**
- Tedious repetition required for progress
- Time-gating to encourage spending
- Boring tasks masquerading as gameplay
- **SupaSnake:** Energy enables faster progress but F2P path is fun, not grinding

**6. Nagging:**
- Constant notifications/reminders
- Interrupting other activities
- Guilt-tripping for not playing
- **SupaSnake:** Minimal notifications, respect player's attention

**7. Social Pressure:**
- "Your friends are ahead of you!"
- Public shaming for not spending
- Forced viral sharing
- **SupaSnake:** Celebrate others' success, no comparison shaming

**8. Confusion:**
- Deliberately unclear mechanics
- Hiding true costs or odds
- Complex currencies obscuring value
- **SupaSnake:** Simple DNA economy, transparent probabilities

**9. Bait and Switch:**
- Free game becomes pay-to-progress
- Tutorial easy, then wall hits
- Advertised features missing/paywalled
- **SupaSnake:** F2P path clear from start, no sudden walls

**10. Exploit Loops:**
- Targeting addiction vulnerabilities
- "Whales" encouraged to spend thousands
- No spending limits
- **SupaSnake:** Energy cap = $6/day maximum, prevents whaling

## Why Designers Use Dark Patterns

**Short-Term Thinking:**
- Maximize immediate revenue
- Meet quarterly targets
- Competitive pressure
- "Everyone else does it"

**Result:** Player trust eroded, long-term harm to industry reputation

## Why SupaSnake Rejects Dark Patterns

**Long-Term Thinking:**
- Build sustainable player base
- Earn reputation for ethical design
- Create positive transformation
- Sleep well at night

**Business Logic:**
- Ethical games build loyal communities
- Word-of-mouth from trusted players
- Stand out in predatory marketplace
- Attract ethically-minded players

**Personal Values:**
- Treat players how I want to be treated
- Build portfolio I'm proud of
- Demonstrate ethical F2P works
- Make mobile gaming better

## Spotting Dark Patterns

**Ask Yourself:**
- Am I being manipulated right now?
- Would this mechanic work without psychological pressure?
- Is the game fun, or am I just compelled?
- Do I feel good about my spending?
- Is the designer being honest with me?

**If answers are concerning, stop playing and leave review warning others.**

## Ethical Alternatives

| Dark Pattern | Ethical Alternative | SupaSnake Example |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| FOMO timers | Play at your pace | Dynasties always available |
| Loot boxes | Transparent odds | Breeding shows exact percentages |
| Pay-to-win | Skill-based competition | Classic Mode leaderboard |
| Grinding | Fun core loop | Snake gameplay is inherently enjoyable |
| Hidden costs | Clear pricing | DNA costs always visible |
| Nagging | Respectful notifications | Optional, non-intrusive |
| Whaling | Spending caps | Energy max = $6/day limit |

## The Ethical Test

**Before implementing ANY monetization or retention mechanic, ask:**
1. Would I defend this on stage at GDC?
2. Would I want my mom to play this?
3. Would investigative journalists find this exploitative?
4. Does this respect player agency and well-being?

**If any answer is "no," it's a dark pattern. Remove it.**
