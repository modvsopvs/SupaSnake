# Lens #110: The Lens of the Team - Quick Reference

**Source**: Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (3rd Edition), Chapter 26

**Adaptation**: Schell assumes 10-100 person teams. This lens is adapted for solo developers and future 2-3 person teams.

## The Lens (Solo Dev Adaptation)

**Ask yourself**:
- Am I the right person to build this game alone? (Skills, passion, stamina)
- What parts of development am I bad at? (Can I outsource, automate, or scope out?)
- When would I need help? (What triggers hiring?)
- How can I preserve solo dev benefits while growing? (Avoid bureaucracy)

## Solo Dev Self-Assessment

**Your Strengths**:
- What do you love doing? (Code, design, art, marketing?)
- What are you world-class at? (Focus here)
- What gives you energy? (Do more of this)

**Your Weaknesses**:
- What drains you? (Community management, 3D modeling, marketing?)
- What are you mediocre at? (Outsource this FIRST when revenue allows)
- What's blocking progress? (This is your bottleneck)

**For SupaSnake Example**:
- Strengths: Systems design, TypeScript, game economy
- Weaknesses: 3D art, social media marketing
- First hire: Artist (free you from weakest skill)

## Team Growth Decision Matrix

| Situation | Action | Why |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| **Revenue < $5k/month** | Stay solo | Can't afford payroll |
| **Revenue $5k-10k/month** | Hire part-time artist | Frees your time for high-value work |
| **Revenue $10k-20k/month** | Add community manager | Community demanding more time |
| **Revenue $20k+/month** | Consider engineer #2 | Can afford technical depth |

**Revenue threshold gates hiring** - don't hire on hype or hope.

## Team Culture (Even at 2-3 People)

**Async by Default**:
- Loom videos > meetings (watch on own time)
- Written docs > verbal agreements (searchable, persistent)
- Pull requests with context > "can you check this?"

**Minimal Meetings**:
- Weekly 30-minute sync (what shipped, what's blocked, priorities)
- No daily standups (overhead too high for tiny team)
- Decisions in Notion, not Slack (async, documented)

**Clear Ownership**:
- Developer: Core systems, architecture, final say
- Artist: All visual content, no code changes
- Community Manager: Discord/Reddit, no game design decisions

## Red Flags (Bad Team Dynamics)

❌ **Scope Creep** - Team wants to add everything (need ruthless prioritization)
❌ **Ego Battles** - Designer vs. Engineer arguing for weeks (founder makes final call)
❌ **Unequal Effort** - One person working 60 hours, other working 10 (address immediately)
❌ **Poor Communication** - Surprises, no documentation, "I thought you were doing X"

## Solo Dev Advantages (Don't Lose These)

**Speed**:
- No design-by-committee (you decide, you ship)
- No context-switching meetings
- Tight feedback loops (test, iterate, repeat)

**Flexibility**:
- Change direction instantly (no buy-in needed)
- Work whenever you want (no coordination)
- Take risks (no one to convince)

**Simplicity**:
- No HR issues, no management overhead
- Full creative control
- Simple financial model (your time, your revenue)

**When growing, preserve these** - don't hire just to feel "legitimate."

## Future Team Questions

**Before First Hire**:
- Can I clearly define the role? (20 hours/week doing X, Y, Z)
- Can I afford this for 6+ months? (Don't hire, then lay off)
- Will this free me to do higher-value work? (Not just delegating busywork)
- Do I WANT to manage someone? (Hiring = management, even contractors)

**Before Second Hire**:
- Is first hire working well? (Don't compound mistakes)
- Is the bottleneck truly time, not direction? (Hire won't fix unclear vision)
- Can I onboard this person without derailing first hire? (Coordination overhead)

## Schell's Team Principles (Adapted)

**Trust Over Process**:
- Hire people you trust, then trust them
- Avoid heavyweight project management (Jira, daily standups)
- Focus on outcomes, not hours logged

**Communication is Everything**:
- Overcommunicate early (Loom videos, detailed docs)
- Weekly syncs to stay aligned
- Written decisions in shared Notion

**Know When to Be Alone**:
- Solo dev for v1.0 (faster, simpler)
- Small team for scaling (deliberate growth)
- Don't hire because "real companies have teams"
