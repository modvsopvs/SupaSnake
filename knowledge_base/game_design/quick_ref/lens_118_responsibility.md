# Lens #118: Responsibility - Quick Reference

**Source:** Schell, Chapter 34 "Responsibility"

## The Lens

**To use this lens, ask yourself:**

- What responsibility do I have to my players?
- What responsibility do I have to my client/employer?
- What responsibility do I have to my team?
- What responsibility do I have to my family?
- What responsibility do I have to the world at large?
- What responsibility do I have to myself?

## Purpose

**This lens reminds you that game design is not just about mechanics and fun - it's about ethics and responsibility to everyone affected by your work.**

## Application to SupaSnake

**Responsibility to Players:**
- **Time:** Energy system respects natural stopping points, no FOMO
- **Money:** Transparent pricing, spending caps ($6/day max), fair value
- **Mental Health:** No addiction mechanics, positive community, moderation plans
- **Well-being:** Transformative (teach strategy), not exploitative
- **Honesty:** Exact probabilities shown, accurate marketing, no deception

**Responsibility to Client/Employer (Self):**
- **Financial Sustainability:** Build profitable game ethically
- **Skill Development:** Learn React Native, mobile F2P, game design deeply
- **Portfolio Quality:** Ship something I'm proud to show
- **Career Building:** Foundation for sustainable indie career
- **Integrity:** Never compromise ethics for short-term profit

**Responsibility to Team (Future):**
- **Clean Codebase:** Well-documented, maintainable if I hire help
- **Ethical Foundation:** Systems designed ethically from start
- **Scalable Architecture:** Can grow with team
- **Good Reputation:** Player trust is team asset

**Responsibility to Family:**
- **Financial:** Don't bet rent money on game success
- **Time:** Sustainable dev pace (20-30 hrs/week), not all-consuming
- **Health:** Protect physical/mental well-being during dev
- **Presence:** Available for family, not perpetually crunching

**Responsibility to World:**
- **Industry Standards:** Prove ethical mobile F2P works
- **Player Protection:** Don't add to predatory mobile reputation
- **Inspire Others:** Open documentation helps other indie devs
- **Cultural Impact:** Positive transformation, not exploitation

**Responsibility to Myself:**
- **Health:** Sustainable pace, no burnout
- **Values:** Stay true to ethical principles
- **Growth:** Continuous skill development
- **Joy:** Work on project I'm passionate about

## Responsibility Conflicts

**When responsibilities conflict, prioritize:**
1. **Player Well-being** (non-negotiable)
2. **Personal Values/Health** (sustainability)
3. **Financial Sustainability** (necessary for 1 & 2)
4. **Team/Family** (support system)
5. **Industry Impact** (bonus, not requirement)

**Example Conflict:**
- **Pressure:** "Add loot boxes for higher revenue"
- **Conflict:** Profit (responsibility to self) vs. Player well-being
- **Resolution:** Player well-being wins, find ethical revenue path
- **Result:** Energy system instead of loot boxes

## Responsibility Checks

**Before Every Design Decision:**
- Does this respect players?
- Does this align with my values?
- Would I defend this publicly?
- Can I sustain this pace?
- Am I being honest?

**If any answer is "no," reconsider.**

## Red Lines (Non-Negotiable)

**Never compromise on:**
- Player safety and well-being
- Honesty and transparency
- Personal integrity
- Team member respect (if/when hiring)
- Community safety

**These are responsibilities, not suggestions.**

## Balancing Act

**SupaSnake Responsibility Balance:**
- **Players:** Ethical F2P, transparent, transformative
- **Self:** Sustainable dev, skill building, portfolio
- **Future Team:** Clean code, ethical foundation
- **Family:** Healthy pace, financial safety net
- **Industry:** Proof ethical works, open learnings

**All can coexist when ethics come first.**
