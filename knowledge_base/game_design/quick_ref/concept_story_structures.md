# Story Structures - Quick Reference

## Classic Story Structures (Schell's Framework)

### The Hero's Journey (Campbell)
**Structure**: Ordinary World → Call to Adventure → Trials → Transformation → Return
**Game Application**: Player starts weak, faces challenges, gains mastery, achieves completion
**SupaSnake Mapping**:
- **Ordinary World**: Tutorial, first Common snakes
- **Call to Adventure**: Discover breeding system, see Legendary variants
- **Trials**: Breeding challenges, resource management, RNG setbacks
- **Transformation**: Understanding formulas, strategic mastery
- **Return**: Dynasty mastery achievement, collection completion

### Three-Act Structure
**Structure**: Setup (25%) → Confrontation (50%) → Resolution (25%)
**Game Application**: Introduction → Core gameplay loop → Endgame completion
**SupaSnake Mapping**:
- **Act 1**: Learn breeding, collect first 5-10 variants (easy wins)
- **Act 2**: Grind for Rares/Epics, manage resources, experience setbacks
- **Act 3**: Hunt final Legendaries, complete mastery, celebrate achievement

### The Story Spine (Pixar)
**Structure**: "Once upon a time... Every day... Until one day... Because of that... Until finally..."
**SupaSnake Example**:
- Once upon a time: "I started SupaSnake as casual player"
- Every day: "I bred snakes hoping for rare variants"
- Until one day: "I got my first Legendary after 40 breeds!"
- Because of that: "I became obsessed with completing CYBER"
- Until finally: "I achieved full dynasty mastery"

## Micro-Stories vs. Macro-Stories

### Macro-Story (Overall Journey)
**Timeframe**: Weeks to months
**SupaSnake**: Your complete collection journey from 0 to all 27 variants
**Structure**: Hero's journey of mastery achievement
**Emotional Arc**: Curiosity → Engagement → Obsession → Satisfaction

### Micro-Stories (Session-Level)
**Timeframe**: Single play session (5-20 minutes)
**SupaSnake**: Today's breeding attempts and results
**Structure**: Hope → Attempt → Result → Reaction
**Emotional Arc**: Anticipation → Action → Surprise → Reflection

## Applied Story Structures for SupaSnake

### Per-Session Story Arc
```
1. Login (Setup): See current collection, set breeding goal
2. Breeding Attempts (Rising Action): 3-5 breeds, building anticipation
3. Results (Climax): Reveal new variants (or duplicates)
4. Reaction (Falling Action): Celebrate wins, accept setbacks
5. Planning (Resolution): Decide tomorrow's strategy
```

**Design Goal**: Each session feels like complete mini-story with beginning/middle/end.

### Per-Dynasty Story Arc
```
1. Discovery (Act 1): First variants come easily, excitement builds
2. Plateau (Act 2): Rares become harder, resource constraints appear
3. Hunt (Late Act 2): Chasing specific remaining variants
4. Completion (Act 3): Final Legendary obtained, mastery achieved
```

**Design Goal**: Each dynasty completion feels like finishing a chapter.

### Overall Game Story Arc
```
1. Novice (0-9 variants): Learning systems, easy progress
2. Collector (10-18 variants): Strategic choices matter, slowdown begins
3. Completionist (19-26 variants): Dedicated grinding, high investment
4. Master (27 variants): Achievement unlocked, pride moment
```

**Design Goal**: Full game feels like epic journey with clear progression phases.

## Pacing Narrative Through Difficulty

**Schell's Principle**: Story pacing should mirror challenge curve.

**SupaSnake Implementation**:
- **Early**: Fast progression = exciting beginning
- **Middle**: Slower gains = building tension
- **Late**: Rare wins = dramatic climaxes
- **Completion**: Achievement = satisfying resolution

## Conflict Types in Collection Games

### External Conflict (Player vs. System)
- RNG refusing to give desired variant
- Energy limits preventing more attempts
- DNA costs requiring resource management

### Internal Conflict (Player vs. Self)
- "Should I breed now or save DNA?"
- "Do I focus one dynasty or spread efforts?"
- "Am I wasting time on this game?"

### No Conflict (Pure Collection)
- Sometimes players just enjoy collecting without struggle
- Not every story needs high tension
- Relaxing progression can be valid narrative

**SupaSnake Balance**: Gentle conflict (RNG challenge) without frustration (all variants eventually obtainable).

## Narrative Hooks for Minimal Story Games

**Schell's Advice**: Even games with minimal authored story need narrative hooks:

**Visual Hooks** (SupaSnake Primary):
- Dynasty aesthetics suggest world/theme
- Variant designs suggest personality
- Rarity tiers create status hierarchy

**Naming Hooks** (SupaSnake Secondary):
- Variant names hint at characteristics
- Dynasty names evoke themes
- Achievement titles celebrate milestones

**Mechanical Hooks** (SupaSnake Tertiary):
- Breeding implies genetic lineage
- Energy system implies living creatures
- Collection book implies explorer/naturalist

## Emma vs. Tyler Story Experience

**Emma (Casual)**:
- Experiences micro-stories per session
- "I got a pretty Epic today" = complete narrative
- Doesn't track macro-story consciously
- Story = aesthetic moments

**Tyler (Hardcore)**:
- Experiences macro-story across weeks
- Tracks progression, builds narrative
- "My 30-day speedrun to mastery" = epic tale
- Story = achievement journey
