# Lens #79: The Lens of Competition

## The Question

**"Does my game create healthy competition?"**

## Purpose

Evaluate whether competitive elements motivate players, feel fair, and enhance rather than detract from the experience.

## Key Questions

**Fair Competition**
- Is competition skill-based or pay-based?
- Can all players compete meaningfully?
- Are there multiple tiers/leagues for different skill levels?
- Do late-joiners have a chance?

**Healthy Rivalry**
- Does competition motivate without frustrating?
- Can players enjoy losing as well as winning?
- Is there recognition beyond just first place?
- Does competition bring out the best in players?

**Optional Participation**
- Can solo players enjoy the full game?
- Is competitive content optional extras?
- Are rewards available through multiple paths?
- Do non-competitors feel excluded?

**Avoiding Toxicity**
- Does competition encourage positive behavior?
- Are there safeguards against griefing?
- Can players compete without harming others?
- Is trash talk discouraged by design?

## SupaSnake Application

**Future Leaderboards**
- Dynasty-specific rankings (compete in your specialty)
- Weekly/monthly resets (fresh starts for everyone)
- Rarity-weighted scoring (skill, not just quantity)
- Multiple tiers (compete with similar players)

**Collection Challenges**
- Time-limited events (prevents burnout)
- Multiple reward tiers (recognition at all levels)
- "First to complete" races (speed skill)
- Rarest pull contests (celebrates luck moments)

**Fair Competition Design**
- No pay-to-win advantages in scoring
- Transparent algorithms
- Skill-based, not wallet-based
- Optional participation (doesn't gate core content)

**Mobile-Friendly Competition**
- Asynchronous (no real-time required)
- Check rankings in 5 seconds
- Progress saved instantly
- Compete across time zones

## Red Flags

- ❌ Only paying players can win
- ❌ Competition feels mandatory for progression
- ❌ Late-joiners can't catch up (never fresh starts)
- ❌ Only first place gets meaningful rewards
- ❌ Competition encourages toxic behavior
- ❌ Real-time requirements exclude casual players
- ❌ Losing feels punishing rather than motivating

## Success Indicators

- ✅ Players enjoy competing even when not winning
- ✅ Diverse players (not just whales) top leaderboards
- ✅ Competition drives personal improvement
- ✅ Community celebrates others' achievements
- ✅ Seasonal resets keep competition fresh
- ✅ Solo players don't feel forced to compete
- ✅ Rivalry is friendly, not hostile

## Competition Types

**Individual Leaderboards**
- Personal achievement showcase
- Dynasty expertise demonstration
- Collection completion speed
- Rarity accumulation (weighted fairly)

**Guild vs. Guild** (Future)
- Cooperative within guild, competitive between
- Shared goals create team spirit
- Multiple guilds can "win" their tier
- Social bonding through friendly rivalry

**Self-Competition**
- Personal bests
- Progress tracking
- Improvement over time
- No external pressure

## Balancing Competition

**Too Little Competition**
- No social motivation
- Missing prestige/recognition
- Reduced replay value
- No aspirational goals

**Too Much Competition**
- Stressful, not fun
- Pay-to-win concerns
- Toxic community
- Excludes casual players

**SupaSnake Balance**
- Optional competitive features
- Multiple paths to rewards
- Healthy rivalry, not cutthroat
- Recognition beyond winning
