# Intrinsic Motivation - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (3rd Edition, 2020), Chapter 11

## Core Concept

Intrinsic motivation comes from within—you do something because you genuinely enjoy it, not for external rewards. It's the "wanna" that drives voluntary engagement. The more motivation comes from "your true self," the more intrinsic it is.

## Key Points

- **Definition**: Doing something for its own sake, not for external rewards
- **Internal Source**: Motivation comes from personal enjoyment, curiosity, mastery desire
- **Fragility**: Adding extrinsic rewards to intrinsically motivating activities can drain intrinsic motivation (the "drawing study" effect—paid children drew lower quality and stopped when payment ended)
- **Continuum**: Not binary—exists on a spectrum from fully internal to fully external
- **Staying Power**: Intrinsic motivation creates longer-lasting engagement than pure extrinsic rewards

## Application to SupaSnake

**Intrinsic Drivers in SupaSnake:**
- **Snake Mastery**: Perfecting runs, dodging skills, survival time (Tyler persona)
- **Breeding Discovery**: Figuring out optimal breeding combinations
- **Strategy Optimization**: Finding efficient DNA-earning routes
- **Personal Bests**: Beating your own high scores without external pressure

**Risk**: Energy monetization and DNA rewards could undermine Snake's intrinsic fun if players feel "forced" to grind. SupaSnake mitigates this by keeping Snake gameplay skill-focused—DNA is earned through performance, not time grinding.

## Modern Mobile Context (2020)

**3rd Edition (2020):** Schell warns about "gamification" pitfalls—adding points and badges to intrinsically motivating activities can backfire.

**SupaSnake Specific:** Energy system must not turn Snake from "wanna" (fun skill challenge) to "hafta" (daily chore). Solution: Energy creates scarcity value without removing Snake's core fun. Tyler plays Snake *because it's fun*, not because energy forces him to.
