# Empathy & Player Projection - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (2008), Chapter 8

## Core Concept

To design for players, you must **project yourself into their mind** - see what they see, feel what they feel, think what they think. This requires active empathy: imagining yourself as your target player at their age, with their experiences, desires, and constraints.

## Walt Disney's Technique

Disney would crouch to children's eye level when inspecting Disneyland to see the park from their perspective - both physically (height) and mentally (excitement, wonder, fears).

## Projection Strategies

**If You Were Your Target Audience:**
- Recall your own memories of that age/situation
- Remember what mattered to you, what you loved, what frustrated you
- Keep these memories "well-oiled" - your most valuable design tools

**If You've Never Been Your Target Audience:**
- Study people in that demographic intensely
- Spend time with them, observe them, talk to them
- Practice imagining being them (like cultural anthropology)

## Application to SupaSnake

**Primary Target: Busy 25-35 Casual Mobile Players**

**Project Into Their Reality:**
- **Time:** 3-minute commute, bathroom break, waiting for coffee
- **Mental state:** Seeking brief escape, low cognitive load acceptable
- **Device:** Phone in one hand, may be interrupted anytime
- **Gaming history:** Played Snake in 2000s on Nokia, fond memories
- **Motivation:** Low-pressure fun, sense of progress without commitment

**Questions Through Their Eyes:**
- "Will this frustrate me if interrupted mid-round?" (No - Snake rounds are 2-3 min)
- "Do I feel pressure to play NOW or miss out?" (No - energy refills, no FOMO)
- "Can I understand this while half-distracted?" (Yes - simple core, depth optional)
- "Does this respect my limited time?" (Yes - meaningful progress in short sessions)

**Secondary Target: 10-18 Obsessive Collectors**

**Project Into Their Reality:**
- **Time:** Hours available, seeking deep engagement
- **Mental state:** Want to master system, discover secrets, compete
- **Device:** Tablet or phone, dedicated sessions
- **Gaming history:** Pokémon, collection games, competitive games
- **Motivation:** Completion, mastery, showing off achievements

**Questions Through Their Eyes:**
- "Is there enough depth for me?" (Yes - breeding strategy, rare variants)
- "Can I show off my collection?" (v0.5+ social features)
- "Are there secrets to discover?" (Yes - hidden breeding combinations)
- "Can I compete?" (Yes - leaderboards, speedruns)

## The Childhood Language Principle

**Schell's Insight:** "To truly communicate with someone, you must speak the language of their childhood."

**SupaSnake Application:**
- **For 30-somethings:** Nokia Snake nostalgia (simple, addictive, accessible)
- **For teens:** Pokémon DNA (collect, breed, evolve, discover)
- **Universal:** Panini sticker book (childhood joy of completion)

## Modern Context

**2008 Context:** Designing for yourself (game designers play games)
**2025 Mobile F2P:** Designing for non-gamers requires stronger empathy (your mom, your busy friend, casual players who don't identify as "gamers")

**SupaSnake Challenge:** Designers are gamers, but target includes non-gamers. Must project beyond personal experience.
