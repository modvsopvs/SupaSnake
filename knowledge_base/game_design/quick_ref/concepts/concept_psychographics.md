# Psychographics - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (2008), Chapter 8

## Core Concept

Psychographics focus on **internal motivations** (what players enjoy) rather than external demographics (who they are). Understanding psychographic profiles reveals why players play and what pleasures they seek.

## LeBlanc's Eight Game Pleasures

1. **Sensation** - Visual/audio beauty, tactile joy
2. **Fantasy** - Imagining yourself as something else
3. **Narrative** - Dramatic unfolding of events
4. **Challenge** - Problems to solve, mastery
5. **Fellowship** - Friendship, cooperation, community
6. **Discovery** - Finding new things, exploration
7. **Expression** - Creating, designing, self-expression
8. **Submission** - Entering the magic circle, leaving reality

## Bartle's Four Player Types

1. **♦ Achievers** - Complete goals, seek Challenge
2. **♠ Explorers** - Discover everything, seek Discovery
3. **♥ Socializers** - Build relationships, seek Fellowship
4. **♣ Killers** - Compete and dominate others

## Additional Pleasures

- **Anticipation, Triumph (fiero), Wonder**
- **Purification** (clear all dots/enemies)
- **Gift Giving, Pride (naches)**
- **Surprise, Thrill, Humor**

## Application to SupaSnake

**Primary Pleasures Delivered:**

**Collection Lab (Core Experience):**
- **Discovery** - Finding new variants, uncovering rare dynasties
- **Purification** - Completing Panini book sections (satisfaction of "all collected")
- **Anticipation** - Breeding outcomes, next energy refresh
- **Pride** - Completing difficult collections, rare variants

**Classic Mode:**
- **Challenge** - High score mastery, perfect runs
- **Triumph** - Beating personal best, no-hit achievement
- **Submission** - Flow state during intense Snake gameplay

**Breeding Lab:**
- **Discovery** - Learning breeding combinations
- **Expression** - Building custom dynasty lineages
- **Anticipation** - Waiting for generation results

**Energy System:**
- **Anticipation** - Energy refilling creates return pattern
- **Possibility** - "What should I spend energy on?"

**Player Type Mapping:**
- **♦ Achievers:** Complete all collections, max out dynasties
- **♠ Explorers:** Find all breeding combinations, discover rare variants
- **♥ Socializers:** (v0.5+) Share collections, trade variants
- **♣ Killers:** Leaderboard competition, speedrun challenges

## Modern Context

**2008 Context:** Focus on single-player console experiences
**2025 Mobile F2P:** Psychographics drive engagement loops, retention mechanics, social features

**SupaSnake Strategy:**
- **Launch (v0.1):** Achievers + Explorers (collection + discovery)
- **v0.5:** Add Socializers (sharing, community)
- **v1.0:** Add Killers (PvP, tournaments)
