# Demographics - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (2008), Chapter 8

## Core Concept

Demographics are external groupings of players (age, gender, income, etc.) that correlate with play preferences. Understanding your target demographic is essential for designing experiences they'll enjoy.

## Age Groups (2025 Mobile Context)

- **7-9 (Kids):** First independent game choices, simple collection games
- **10-13 (Tweens):** "Age of obsession" - passionate about interests, competitive
- **13-18 (Teens):** Gender divergence (boys: competition/mastery, girls: communication/real-world)
- **18-24 (Young Adults):** Established tastes, time + money for gaming
- **25-35 (Peak Family):** Time-constrained, casual players, seek quick sessions
- **35-50 (Family Maturation):** Play with children, seek family-friendly experiences
- **50+ (Empty Nesters):** Time returns, social component important

## Gender Considerations

**Males Prefer:**
- Mastery, competition, destruction
- Spatial puzzles, trial-and-error learning

**Females Prefer:**
- Emotion, real-world connections, nurturing
- Dialog/verbal puzzles, learning by example

## Application to SupaSnake

**Primary Target:** 25-35 casual mobile players (peak family formation)
- **Time constraint:** 3-5 minute sessions (Snake rounds)
- **Collection appeal:** Low-pressure Panini book completion
- **Energy system:** Natural stopping point (not frustration)

**Secondary Target:** 10-18 obsessive collectors
- **Breeding depth:** Strategic dynasty building
- **Competition:** Leaderboards (Classic Mode high scores)
- **Mastery:** Perfect no-hit runs, variant collecting

**Gender Balance:**
- **Male appeal:** Mastery (perfect runs), competition (leaderboards), strategy (breeding)
- **Female appeal:** Collection completion, nurturing (breeding snakes), low-pressure gameplay

**SupaSnake's Strength:** Broad demographic appeal through multiple engagement paths (quick casual play + deep collecting).

## Modern Context

**2008 Context:** Console gaming skewed heavily male, teens/young adults
**2025 Mobile F2P:**
- Mobile gaming is 50%+ female
- Casual puzzle/collection games extremely popular with women 25-45
- "Hypercasual" genre serves 5-minute sessions perfectly

**SupaSnake Positioning:** Casual-first (broad appeal), depth optional (retain engaged players).
