# Essential Experience - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (2008), Chapter 2

## Core Concept

You can't replicate real-world experiences perfectly in games—nor should you try. Instead, identify the **essential elements** that define a memorable experience and find ways to capture that essence in your game, even if the delivery is completely different from reality. A snowball fight's essence might include: "it was so cold," "we built a huge fort," "we couldn't stop laughing." Your game doesn't need real snow or temperature to convey coldness—visual effects (breath puffs), sound (wind), or mechanics (cold hands slow snowball-making) can capture the essence. The first lens: **Lens of Essential Experience** asks: (1) What experience do I want? (2) What is essential to it? (3) How can my game capture that essence?

## Key Points

- **Essence, not replication**: Memorable experiences have key features that define them—isolate those
- **Essential vs. incidental**: "It was cold" is essential; "I wore corduroy pants" is incidental
- **Multiple delivery methods**: Convey essence through art, sound, rules, mechanics, UI—whatever works
- **Designer clarity**: Knowing your essential experience prevents aimless wandering—you have a north star
- **Avoid luck-based design**: Without a clear essence, you're hoping random features create good experiences

## Application to SupaSnake

**Applying Lens #1 to SupaSnake - Collection Lab**:

**(1) What experience do I want the player to have?**
"I just caught a rare Pokémon and I'm thrilled to add it to my collection"—the Panini sticker book psychology of "I finally got the one I needed!"

**(2) What is essential to that experience?**
- **Anticipation**: The moment before revealing what you got
- **Rarity hierarchy**: Common vs. rare makes rare feel special
- **Visual distinction**: Seeing the new variant immediately look different
- **Progression**: Building toward a complete collection
- **Surprise**: You didn't know what you'd get

**(3) How can my game capture that essence?**
- **Anticipation**: Lab pull animation (spinner/egg hatch) delays reveal by 2 seconds
- **Rarity hierarchy**: Dynasty system (Crystal = 5% drop rate, Neon = 20%, etc.)
- **Visual distinction**: Each variant has unique color palette + particle effects
- **Progression**: Collection screen shows silhouettes of unlocked/locked variants
- **Surprise**: Weighted RNG, not player choice—you can't just "buy" the Crystal snake

**SupaSnake Example - Essential Experience in Practice**:

**Initial artifact (missing essence)**:
- Tap "Unlock Variant" button → Instant reveal of new snake → No rarity indication → Back to menu

**Player experience**: "Okay, I got a blue snake. So what?"

**Revised artifact (captures essence)**:
- Tap "Spend 20 DNA to Open Egg" → 2-second spinner with sparkle SFX → Egg cracks → "RARE: Crystal Dynasty!" text → Snake appears with glow VFX → Added to collection with fanfare

**Player experience**: "Oh wow, I got a RARE one! And it looks sick. I want the other Crystal variants now."

**Same mechanical outcome** (player gets new variant), but the second **captures the essential experience** of surprise, rarity, and collection progression.
