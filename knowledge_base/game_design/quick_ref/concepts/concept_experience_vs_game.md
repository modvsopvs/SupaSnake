# Experience vs. Game - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (2008), Chapter 2

## Core Concept

The game is not the experience. The game (cards, code, rules) is an artifact—a "means to an end." The experience (what players feel, think, do) is what designers actually care about. Games are worthless without players because the magic only happens during play. Designers create artifacts hoping they'll generate certain experiences, but we never directly control the experience—it exists only in the player's mind. This split between artifact and experience is more obvious in games than in linear media (books, movies) because games grant players control over pacing, sequence, and choices. We trade control for unique feelings: freedom, accomplishment, friendship, responsibility. The paradox: experiences are shadowy and unsharable, yet they're the only thing that matters.

## Key Points

- **Artifact vs. experience**: The game (physical/digital object) enables the experience (player's mental state)
- **"If a tree falls..."**: If no one plays your game, the experience doesn't exist—only the artifact exists
- **Indirect creation**: Designers build artifacts and hope they generate intended experiences
- **Unsharable experiences**: No two players have identical experiences of the same game
- **Games vs. linear media**: Games sacrifice designer control for player agency, creating unique experiential possibilities

## Application to SupaSnake

Mobile F2P ruthlessly exposes the artifact/experience split—you ship an APK (artifact), but App Store algorithms measure **experience** (retention, session length, DAU/MAU).

**Artifact**: SupaSnake's code, sprites, breeding formula, energy timers, Collection Lab UI
**Experience**: "I just unlocked a rare Crystal variant and I'm excited to breed it for Generation 2!"

**Why this matters**:
- **You can perfect the artifact and fail**: Your breeding formula could be mathematically elegant but feel unrewarding
- **Experiences are unsharable**: You can't A/B test "fun"—you infer it from behavior (session length, return rate)
- **Player agency amplifies the split**: In SupaSnake, players choose when to spend DNA, which variants to breed, whether to play Classic or chill in Collection Lab—you can't script their experience

**SupaSnake Example - Session Flow**:
- **Artifact you built**: Open app → 5-energy gate → Play Snake → Earn 20 DNA → Spend on Lab pull → Unlock variant → Close app
- **Experience Player A had**: "Quick dopamine hit, got a cool snake, I'll be back tomorrow"
- **Experience Player B had**: "Only 20 DNA? Lab pull costs 50. This is grindy. Uninstall."

**Same artifact, different experiences.** Your job: tune the artifact (change DNA earn rate from 20 → 30) to increase the chance Player B has Player A's experience.

## Modern Context (if dated)

**2008 Context:** Schell discusses console games and "artificial reality" as a distant dream (direct brain experiences)
**2025 Mobile F2P:** The artifact/experience split is even wider—monetization gates (energy, gacha) mean the artifact actively limits experience to drive revenue. Ethical F2P design means balancing "artifact constraints" (timers, costs) against "experience quality" (fun, respect for player time).
