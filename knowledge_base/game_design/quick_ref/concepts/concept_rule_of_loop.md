# Rule of the Loop - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (2008), Chapter 7

## Core Concept

**The more times you test and improve your design, the better your game will be.** There are no exceptions. Every iteration loop makes the game better. The challenge is maximizing loops within budget/time constraints.

## Key Questions

1. **Loop Question 1:** How can I make every loop count?
   - **Answer:** Assess risks and mitigate them (spiral model)

2. **Loop Question 2:** How can I loop as fast as possible?
   - **Answer:** Build many rough prototypes

## Application to SupaSnake

**Fast Loop Priorities:**
- **Collection Lab:** Paper prototype Panini book mechanic (hours, not weeks)
- **Breeding System:** Spreadsheet simulation before coding (test 1000 combinations instantly)
- **Energy System:** Tune values in config files, not hardcoded (change & test in minutes)
- **Dynasty Variants:** Test visual variants with mockups before 3D rendering

**SupaSnake Loop Strategy:**
1. Week 1: Paper prototype collection psychology
2. Week 2: Config-driven energy system (easy tuning)
3. Week 3-4: Minimal Snake + DNA economy
4. Week 5+: Iterate based on playtesting

**Mobile F2P Advantage:**
Post-launch loops continue via:
- A/B testing (energy costs, variant rarity)
- Analytics (where players drop off)
- Soft launch markets (test before global)

## Modern Context

**2008 Context:** Limited loops before retail box ship date (no patches)
**2025 Mobile F2P:** Continuous loops post-launch through live ops, but core fun must exist at v0.1

**SupaSnake Philosophy:**
Loop fast pre-launch (validate core), loop continuously post-launch (optimize retention/monetization).
