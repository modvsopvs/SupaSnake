# Eight Filters - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (2008), Chapter 7

## Core Concept

Every game design must pass through eight distinct filters before it's "good enough." Changes that pass one filter may fail another, requiring continuous iteration until the design survives all eight tests simultaneously.

## The Eight Filters

1. **Artistic Impulse** - Does this feel right to me as designer?
2. **Demographics** - Will the intended audience like this enough?
3. **Experience Design** - Is this well-designed?
4. **Innovation** - Is this novel enough?
5. **Business/Marketing** - Will this sell?
6. **Engineering** - Can we technically build this?
7. **Social/Community** - Does this meet social goals?
8. **Playtesting** - Do playtesters enjoy this enough?

## Application to SupaSnake

**Filter Priority for Mobile F2P:**
- **Demographics (#2):** CRITICAL - Casual mobile players, collection enthusiasts
- **Experience (#3):** Core Snake + Panini book psychology must delight
- **Engineering (#6):** React Native feasibility, Supabase scaling
- **Playtesting (#8):** Energy system retention, breeding engagement
- **Business (#5):** F2P-friendly (DNA economy, no pay-to-win in v0.1)

**SupaSnake-Specific Filters:**
- Collection appeal (does Panini book model work?)
- Energy system balance (frustration vs retention)
- Breeding depth (enough strategy without overwhelming?)

**Iteration Pattern:**
Each Dynasty variant must pass all filters. Failed filter = redesign and retest all eight.

## Modern Context

**2008 Context:** Focus on console/PC retail box sales, upfront purchase decision
**2025 Mobile F2P:** Filters applied continuously post-launch through analytics, A/B testing, live ops
