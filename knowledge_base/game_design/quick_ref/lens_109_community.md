# Lens #109: The Lens of Community - Quick Reference

**Source**: Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (3rd Edition), Chapter 25

## The Lens

**Ask yourself**:
- Why would players want to be part of this community?
- What brings them together beyond just playing the game?
- How can I foster positive community culture from day one?
- What community features can I provide with minimal overhead?

## Mobile Collection Game Application

**Community Motivations for SupaSnake**:
- **Shared Passion** - Love of collecting, completing sets, hunting rare variants
- **Knowledge Sharing** - Breeding formulas, DNA farming strategies, variant tier lists
- **Status Display** - Showcasing rare collections, being first to unlock new dynasty
- **Social Connection** - Finding others who appreciate niche snake collecting game

**Async Community Design**:
- Players don't need to play together, just share passion
- Discord for real-time chat, Reddit for long-form guides
- In-game: screenshot sharing, leaderboards (no real-time co-op needed)

## Solo Dev Community Priorities

**High Impact, Low Overhead**:
1. **Subreddit** - Set up with 5 FAQs, let players post guides organically
2. **Discord** - 3 channels (announcements, general, guides), 2-3 volunteer mods
3. **Twitter** - Share updates, retweet fan art (10 minutes/day)
4. **Celebrate Players** - Pin best guides, feature rare pulls, monthly spotlight

**Avoid (Too Much Overhead)**:
- Custom forums (use Reddit instead)
- In-game chat (moderation nightmare)
- Official wiki (let community build on Fandom)
- 24/7 community management (set async expectations)

## Community Health Questions

**Am I fostering positivity?**
- Celebrating player achievements (first rare pull, completed collection)
- Featuring player-created guides in official channels
- Transparent about roadmap without overpromising

**Am I preventing toxicity?**
- Clear community rules (no real-money trading, be respectful)
- AutoMod for spam/profanity
- Volunteer moderators for coverage
- Quick action on harassment (zero tolerance)

**Is community self-sustaining?**
- Players answering each other's questions (not just dev)
- User-generated content (breeding guides, fan art, strategy videos)
- Community events organized by players (not just dev)

## Red Flags

- Developer is only active community member (need to seed early)
- All posts are complaints/feature requests (need to foster positive culture)
- Community depends on dev for answers (need to empower knowledgeable players)
- Moderation takes >5 hours/week (need automation + volunteer mods)
