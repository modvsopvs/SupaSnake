# Sustainable Creative Practice - Quick Reference

**Source:** Schell, Chapter 35 "Your Purpose"

## Core Concept

**Game development is a marathon, not a sprint.** Sustainable creative practice means working in ways that you can maintain for decades, not burning out in months.

## Principles of Sustainability

**1. Protect Your Health:**
- Physical: Sleep, exercise, nutrition
- Mental: Therapy, breaks, boundaries
- Emotional: Process stress, celebrate wins
- Social: Maintain relationships outside work

**2. Set Realistic Scope:**
- Build what you can actually finish
- Solo dev? Design for solo capabilities
- Ruthlessly cut features that don't serve core
- Ship small, iterate based on feedback

**3. Work in Cycles:**
- Intense work periods followed by recovery
- Plan breaks between major milestones
- Don't crunch indefinitely
- Listen to your body's signals

**4. Maintain Multiple Interests:**
- Don't make games your entire identity
- Hobbies outside gamedev
- Family and friend time
- Physical activities

**5. Build Financial Cushion:**
- Save runway before going indie
- Plan for slow revenue growth
- Don't bet everything on one game
- Have backup income plans

## SupaSnake Sustainability Practices

**Scope Management:**
- **Solo dev scope:** No features requiring team
- **MVP v0.1:** 3 dynasties, basic mechanics
- **Iterative expansion:** Monthly dynasty releases
- **Optional features:** Multiplayer deferred to post-launch

**Time Management:**
- **No crunch:** 20-30 hours/week max
- **Milestone breaks:** 1 week off after major versions
- **Sustainable pace:** 12-18 month dev cycle acceptable
- **Burnout prevention:** Stop when tired, resume refreshed

**Financial Planning:**
- **Runway saved:** 6 months living expenses
- **Conservative estimates:** Plan for $500/month revenue initially
- **Multiple income:** Contract work during dev if needed
- **Long view:** Success measured over years, not weeks

**Health Protection:**
- **Physical:** Regular exercise, standing desk, eye breaks
- **Mental:** Therapy when needed, journaling, meditation
- **Social:** Weekly friend time, family connections
- **Emotional:** Celebrate small wins, process setbacks

## Warning Signs of Unsustainability

**Stop and reassess if experiencing:**
- Chronic exhaustion (mental or physical)
- Loss of joy in work
- Relationship strain
- Health problems
- Financial anxiety spiraling
- Resentment toward project
- Comparing yourself to others constantly
- Difficulty sleeping due to work stress

**Action:** Take break, reduce scope, seek support, reframe timeline

## Sustainable vs. Unsustainable Mindsets

| Unsustainable | Sustainable |
|---------------|-------------|
| "Must launch in 6 months" | "Launch when ready" |
| "Work every waking hour" | "Protect my health" |
| "This game must succeed" | "This game teaches me" |
| "Crunch is necessary" | "Crunch means bad planning" |
| "Sacrifice everything" | "Balance is strength" |
| "Compare to AAA teams" | "Solo dev is different" |
| "Never good enough" | "Progress worth celebrating" |

## Sustainability for Solo Devs

**Unique challenges:**
- Wearing all hats (design, code, art, marketing, business)
- No team support or accountability
- Self-motivation required daily
- Isolation and loneliness
- Decision fatigue

**Solutions:**
- **Community:** Join indie dev communities (Discord, Reddit, local meetups)
- **Structure:** Set daily/weekly routines
- **Outsource:** Hire for weak areas (art, audio, marketing)
- **Learning:** Budget time for skill development
- **Celebration:** Share wins publicly, get external validation

## Long-Term Career Thinking

**SupaSnake is one game of many:**
- **Learning project:** Skills transfer to next game
- **Portfolio piece:** Shows capabilities to publishers/teams
- **Community building:** Players become advocates
- **Reputation:** Ethical designer known for quality

**Don't bet entire career on one game succeeding financially.**

## Questions for Sustainability Check

1. Can I work this way for 10 years?
2. Am I sacrificing my health?
3. Are relationships suffering?
4. Do I still find joy in the work?
5. Am I comparing myself to teams of 100?
6. Is my timeline realistic for solo dev?
7. Do I have financial safety net?

**If any answer is concerning, adjust your practice.**

## The Sustainable Path

**SupaSnake Development Plan:**
- 12-18 months to v1.0 launch (realistic solo timeline)
- 20-30 hours/week work (sustainable pace)
- Contract work for income during dev (financial safety)
- Monthly breaks after milestones (burnout prevention)
- Community support (Discord, indie dev groups)
- Health first (exercise, sleep, therapy when needed)
- Long view (success measured in years)

**Result:** Game I'm proud of AND career I can sustain for decades.
