# Space Design - Quick Reference

## Core Concept

Game spaces are not just containers for action—they are designed environments that communicate purpose, guide player behavior, and create emotional experiences. In SupaSnake, each Lab serves as a distinct architectural space with its own identity, function, and spatial storytelling.

## Key Principles

**Architectural Grammar**
- Spaces communicate through visual language (scale, materials, lighting)
- Form follows function: Lab design reveals purpose at a glance
- Collection Lab: Gallery-like, open, celebratory
- Breeding Lab: Workshop-style, focused, experimental
- Evolution Lab: Chamber-like, transformative, mysterious

**Spatial Storytelling**
- Layout guides player flow and understanding
- Vertical vs horizontal organization affects perception
- Spaces establish hierarchy (what's important)
- Transitions between spaces create rhythm and pacing

**Christopher Alexander's Patterns**
Game spaces benefit from architectural patterns:
- Entrance transitions (prepare player for new context)
- Light on two sides (visual clarity, depth)
- Alcoves (places for special focus)
- Sequence of sitting spaces (comfortable navigation flow)

## SupaSnake Application

**Collection Lab as Gallery**
- Open, browsable space emphasizing display
- Grid or carousel layout for specimen viewing
- Clear visual hierarchy (featured vs collection)
- Easy scanning, comfortable exploration

**Breeding Lab as Workshop**
- Functional, tool-oriented layout
- Parent selection areas clearly defined
- Central combination space (focal point)
- Clear input → process → output flow

**Evolution Lab as Transformation Chamber**
- Mysterious, focused atmosphere
- Single-snake emphasis (ritual feeling)
- Progressive revelation of options
- Dramatic before/after presentation

## Design Guidelines

- **Consistency**: Each Lab maintains recognizable identity
- **Clarity**: Function apparent from spatial arrangement
- **Flow**: Navigation feels natural, not confusing
- **Emotion**: Space supports intended player feeling
