# Lens #20: The Lens of Pleasure

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (3rd Edition, 2020), Chapter 9

## Purpose

Games exist to give pleasure. Examine what pleasures your game provides, what's missing, and what could be improved. Look for unique pleasures not found in most games.

## Questions to Ask

1. **What pleasures does your game give to players? Can these be improved?**
2. **What pleasures are missing from your experience? Why? Can they be added?**

## How to Use This Lens

**Review Pleasure Lists:**
- LeBlanc's 8 (Sensation, Fantasy, Narrative, Challenge, Fellowship, Discovery, Expression, Submission)
- Bartle's 4 player types (Achievers, Explorers, Socializers, Killers)
- Additional pleasures (Anticipation, Completion, Triumph, Pride, Wonder, etc.)

**Don't Limit to Lists:**
Always watch for unique, unclassified pleasures—might give your game its unique quality.

**Context Matters:**
Pleasure is context-sensitive. What's pleasurable at a party (dancing) might be torturous at job interview.

**Unique SupaSnake Pleasures:**

**1. Panini Book Satisfaction:**
- Not in standard pleasure lists
- Deeply satisfying tactile memory (physical sticker books)
- Seeing empty slots fill up = unique completion pleasure
- **Emma's primary pleasure**

**2. Genetic Empire Building:**
- Combination of Collection + Nurturing + Pride
- "I built this dynasty from scratch" (creation pride)
- "I carefully bred these generations" (strategic accomplishment)
- **Tyler's unique satisfaction**

## Design Implications

**Multi-Pleasure Buffet:**
Different players take different pleasures from same systems:
- Snake gameplay: Emma (Submission), Tyler (Challenge)
- Collection Lab: Emma (Completion), Tyler (Discovery)
- Breeding: Emma (optional Nurturing), Tyler (strategic Challenge)

**Gender Balance Through Pleasure Diversity:**
- Male-associated: Challenge, Competition, Discovery, Mastery
- Female-associated: Completion, Nurturing, Anticipation, Fellowship (v0.5)
- BOTH well-served = inclusive design

**Version Roadmap:**
- v0.1: Submission, Sensation, Discovery, Challenge, Completion, Anticipation, Pride, Triumph
- v0.5: ADD Fellowship, Gift Giving (social features)
- v1.0: ADD Expression (customization), light Narrative (lore)

## Tips for Success

✅ **DO:**
- Review pleasure lists regularly during design
- Watch for unique pleasures specific to your game
- Support multiple pleasure types (inclusive design)
- Improve core pleasures before adding new ones

❌ **DON'T:**
- Assume one pleasure fits all players
- Force pleasures on unwilling players (make optional)
- Ignore context (mobile = different pleasures than console)
- Overlook gender-associated pleasure differences
