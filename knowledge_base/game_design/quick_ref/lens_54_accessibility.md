# Lens #54: The Lens of Accessibility - Quick Reference

## Questions to Ask

When presenting a puzzle to players (or a game of any kind), they should be able to clearly visualize their first few steps:

1. **How will players know how to begin** solving my puzzle or playing my game? Do I need to explain it, or is it self-evident?
2. **Does my puzzle/game act like something they've seen before?** If yes, how can I draw attention to that similarity? If no, how can I make them understand how it behaves?
3. **Does my puzzle/game draw people in** and make them want to touch and manipulate it? If not, how can I change it so that it does?

## Application to SupaSnake

**Self-Evident Start (Q1):**
- Snake gameplay: Swipe to move (no explanation needed - universal mobile gesture)
- Collection Lab: Tap to view variants (standard touch interaction)
- No tutorial barriers - players can start Round 1 immediately

**Familiar Patterns (Q2):**
- Acts like classic Snake (most players have seen Snake before)
- Collection acts like Panini sticker book (childhood nostalgia)
- Draw attention: Visual similarity to classic Snake grid, "Gotta catch 'em all" collection feel

**Draw Players In (Q3):**
- Animated DNA orbs floating (movement attracts eye)
- Variant card reveals (satisfying flip animation)
- Snake trail effect (juicy second-order motion)
- Touch-friendly tap targets (easy to manipulate)

## Mobile Touch Context

**Accessibility = Touch-Friendly:**
- Large swipe area (full screen)
- No tiny buttons (Emma can play on moving train)
- Forgiving tap targets in Collection Lab
- Visual feedback on every touch (prevents "did I tap?" confusion)
