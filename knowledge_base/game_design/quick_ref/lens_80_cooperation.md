# Lens #80: The Lens of Cooperation

## The Question

**"Does my game create meaningful cooperation?"**

## Purpose

Evaluate whether cooperative elements create positive social bonds, feel rewarding, and enhance the solo experience rather than replacing it.

## Key Questions

**Mutual Benefit**
- Do all cooperating players gain value?
- Are there win-win interactions?
- Does helping others feel rewarding?
- Can cooperation be exploited?

**Optional Cooperation**
- Can solo players enjoy the full game?
- Is cooperation an enhancement, not requirement?
- Are rewards accessible through solo and social paths?
- Do loners feel excluded?

**Social Bonding**
- Does cooperation create friendships?
- Do players remember positive cooperative moments?
- Does working together feel better than working alone?
- Are there shared triumphs?

**Mobile-Friendly Cooperation**
- Can players cooperate asynchronously?
- No real-time coordination required?
- Quick cooperative actions (1-3 minutes)?
- Works across time zones?
