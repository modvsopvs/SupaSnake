# Indie Game Funding Options - Quick Reference

**Source**: Schell Ch. 32 "Funding Your Game", Ch. 31 "The Pitch"

## Core Principle

**Funding = Fuel for development.** Money buys time (your scarcest resource as indie). Every funding source has trade-offs: equity, creative control, repayment terms, or strings attached.

## Funding Models for Solo Indie Devs

### 1. Self-Funding (Bootstrapping)

**What it is**: Use personal savings, part-time job income, or contract work to fund development

**SupaSnake approach**: Part-time development while employed (evenings/weekends)

**Pros**:
- ✅ 100% ownership (no equity given up)
- ✅ Full creative control (no investor input)
- ✅ No repayment obligation (your money)
- ✅ Learn to ship lean (forced constraints)

**Cons**:
- ❌ Slow development (time split with job)
- ❌ Financial risk (if game fails, lost savings)
- ❌ Stress (personal finances tied to game)
- ❌ Opportunity cost (could earn salary instead)

**When it works**: Small-scope game (3-6 months part-time), low burn rate, stable day job

**SupaSnake budget** (6 months part-time):
- Developer accounts: $124
- Design tools (Figma): $0 (free tier)
- Backend (Supabase): $0 (free tier, scale later)
- Marketing: $500 (optional micro-influencer)
- **Total**: ~$650 (feasible self-funded)

**Timeline**: 6 months (20 hours/week) → Launch

**Risk**: Low financial risk (<$1k), high opportunity cost (500+ hours)

---

### 2. Crowdfunding (Kickstarter, Indiegogo)

**What it is**: Pre-sell game to backers, use funds to finish development

**Model**:
- Set goal ($5k-50k typical)
- Offer rewards (early access, credits, cosmetics)
- All-or-nothing (Kickstarter) or keep-what-you-raise (Indiegogo)

**Pros**:
- ✅ No equity given up (pre-sales, not investment)
- ✅ Validate demand (if campaign fails, idea might be wrong)
- ✅ Build community (backers = early evangelists)
- ✅ Marketing boost (Kickstarter exposure)

**Cons**:
- ❌ Must have demo/prototype (can't fund from zero)
- ❌ Campaign is full-time job (30-60 days marketing)
- ❌ Obligation to deliver (or face backlash)
- ❌ ~40% campaigns fail (don't hit goal)

**When it works**: Proven concept, existing audience (mailing list, Twitter followers), clear pitch

**SupaSnake fit**: Moderate (could Kickstarter for $10-20k to go full-time for 3 months)

**Kickstarter math**:
- Goal: $15,000 (3 months full-time dev)
- Backers needed: 300 @ $50 avg pledge
- Success rate: ~40% (need strong pitch + audience)

**Reward tiers**:
- $5: Name in credits
- $15: Early access (1 month before launch)
- $30: Exclusive variant (Kickstarter Backer Snake)
- $50: Above + lifetime energy (no ads)
- $100: Design a snake variant (collaborative)

**Timeline**: 1 month prep + 30 day campaign + 3 months dev = 5 months

**Risk**: If campaign fails, lost 1 month marketing time (but validated idea is weak)

---

### 3. Indie Game Grants

**What they are**: Non-repayable awards from funds, foundations, or platform holders

**Major grant programs**:
- **Epic MegaGrants**: $5k-500k (Unreal Engine projects preferred)
- **Unity for Humanity**: $10k-500k (social impact games)
- **Apple Design Awards**: Prestige (no money, but featured placement = $$$)
- **IndieGames.com**: $1k-10k (smaller, faster turnaround)

**Pros**:
- ✅ No equity, no repayment (free money)
- ✅ Validation (selective, prestigious)
- ✅ Network (connections to publishers, press)

**Cons**:
- ❌ Extremely competitive (1-5% acceptance)
- ❌ Long process (3-6 months application → decision)
- ❌ Strings attached (platform exclusivity, progress reports)

**When it works**: Unique concept, social good angle, or technical innovation

**SupaSnake fit**: Low (not Unreal/Unity, not social impact) → Skip for now

**Application effort**: 10-20 hours (pitch deck, demo video, budget)

**Success rate**: 1-5% (long shot, but $0 cost to apply)

---

### 4. Publisher Deals (Indie Publishers)

**What they are**: Publisher funds development in exchange for revenue share or IP rights

**Indie-friendly publishers**:
- **Devolver Digital**: Curated, hands-off, 50/50 split typical
- **Annapurna Interactive**: Premium, narrative-focused
- **Raw Fury**: Mid-size, transparent terms
- **Humble Games**: Fair deals, bundle distribution

**Traditional deal**:
- Advance: $50k-500k (recoupable)
- Revenue split: 30-50% to publisher (after recoup)
- Marketing: Publisher handles (events, press, influencers)
- Creative control: Varies (Devolver = light touch, others = heavy)

**Pros**:
- ✅ Upfront cash (full-time development)
- ✅ Marketing expertise (publishers know how to launch)
- ✅ QA/localization/porting (services included)
- ✅ Distribution (featured placements, bundles)

**Cons**:
- ❌ Revenue share (30-50% forever)
- ❌ Creative input (approval rights on design)
- ❌ IP ownership (often publisher owns or co-owns)
- ❌ Multi-year exclusivity (can't self-publish sequel)

**When it works**: Game needs >$100k budget, first-time dev, complex (PC/console, not mobile)

**SupaSnake fit**: Low for v1.0 (mobile self-publishing viable), High for v2.0 (if PC/console port)

**Pitching publishers** (Schell Ch. 31):
1. Build playable prototype (10-30 min experience)
2. Create pitch deck (15 slides: concept, market, team, budget)
3. Email 10-20 publishers (personalized, not mass)
4. Demo at events (GDC, PAX, Gamescom)
5. Negotiate terms (equity, revenue split, creative control)

**Timeline**: 3-6 months (pitch → deal) + 12-18 months (funded dev)

---

### 5. Angel Investors / VC (Tech Investors)

**What they are**: Individual or firm investors funding in exchange for equity

**Terms**:
- Investment: $50k-500k (seed round)
- Equity: 10-30% ownership
- Expectations: 10x return (game must be huge hit or sellable company)

**Pros**:
- ✅ Large capital (scale quickly)
- ✅ Expertise (investors with game industry experience)
- ✅ Network (intros to publishers, press, talent)

**Cons**:
- ❌ Equity dilution (you own less of your game)
- ❌ Growth pressure ("ship fast, monetize hard")
- ❌ Exit expectation (investors want acquisition or IPO)
- ❌ Loss of control (board seats, voting rights)

**When it works**: Building game studio (not one game), mobile F2P with proven traction (10k+ DAU)

**SupaSnake fit**: None for v1.0 (too early), Possible for v2.0+ (if 100k+ users, raise $200k to build team)

**Raising VC** (Schell-adjacent):
1. Build traction (10k+ users, $5k+ MRR)
2. Create pitch deck (market size, unit economics, team, ask)
3. Find gaming-focused VR (Makers Fund, Galaxy Interactive, Bitkraft)
4. 3-month fundraising process (dozens of meetings)
5. Negotiate term sheet (valuation, board seats, liquidation preferences)

**Timeline**: 3-6 months (if you have traction)

**Risk**: If game fails, investors lose money (you lose equity + control)

---

### 6. Government Grants & Tax Credits

**What they are**: Government programs supporting game development (varies by country)

**Examples**:
- **Canada Media Fund**: $50k-500k (Canadian studios)
- **UK Games Fund**: £10k-50k (UK studios)
- **French CNC**: €50k-500k (French studios)
- **US**: None federally (some states have film/media tax credits)

**Pros**:
- ✅ Non-dilutive (no equity)
- ✅ Repayment friendly (often recoup from revenue, not debt)
- ✅ Legitimacy (government backing = credibility)

**Cons**:
- ❌ Geography-locked (must be resident/studio in country)
- ❌ Paperwork (extensive applications, reporting)
- ❌ Delays (6-12 months application → funding)

**SupaSnake fit**: Depends on geography (if US-based indie, no federal grants; if Canadian, viable)

## Pitching Best Practices (Schell Ch. 31)

### The 3-Minute Pitch Structure

**Slide 1: The Hook** (30 seconds)
- "Remember Snake? Now breed and collect them."
- One sentence concept
- Visual (gameplay GIF)

**Slide 2-3: The Problem/Opportunity** (45 seconds)
- Mobile casual games: $50B market
- Breeding games: Proven (Pokémon, Neko Atsume)
- Gap: No breeding + arcade hybrid

**Slide 4-5: The Solution** (60 seconds)
- Classic Snake + Pokémon genetics
- Collection meta-game (gotta catch 'em all)
- F2P monetization (energy + cosmetics)

**Slide 6-7: Traction** (30 seconds)
- Beta: 500 testers, 35% Day 1 retention
- Soft launch: 2,000 downloads, 3% conversion
- Revenue: $500 first month (projected $10k Year 1)

**Slide 8-9: The Ask** (30 seconds)
- Seeking: $50k for 6 months full-time dev
- Use: Hire artist ($20k), marketing ($20k), living expenses ($10k)
- Offer: 20% equity OR 30% revenue share

**Slide 10: Team** (15 seconds)
- Solo dev (you): React Native expert, 10 years web dev
- Advisor: [Game designer friend, if any]

**Total**: 3 minutes (leave 7 minutes for Q&A)

### Common Pitch Mistakes (Schell-Derived)

**Mistake 1: No traction**
- Pitching concept with no demo = 90% rejection
- **Fix**: Build playable prototype before pitching

**Mistake 2: Unclear ask**
- "We need money" → How much? For what?
- **Fix**: Specific ask ($50k for X, Y, Z)

**Mistake 3: No market analysis**
- "Our game is unique!" → Market doesn't care about unique, cares about $ potential
- **Fix**: Comparable games (revenue, users) + your differentiation

**Mistake 4: Over-promising**
- "We'll make $1M Year 1!" → Unrealistic for indie
- **Fix**: Conservative projections (show you understand market)

**Mistake 5: No exit**
- Investors ask "How do I make money?"
- **Fix**: Revenue share, equity + acquisition potential, or IP licensing

## Funding Decision Matrix

| Funding Source | Amount | Equity Cost | Time to Get | Best For |
|----------------|--------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Self-funded | $0-5k | 0% | Immediate | Small scope, part-time |
| Crowdfunding | $10-50k | 0% | 2-3 months | Proven concept, audience |
| Grants | $5-50k | 0% | 3-6 months | Unique/innovative games |
| Publisher | $50-500k | 30-50% revenue | 3-6 months | First game, need marketing |
| Angel/VC | $100-500k | 10-30% equity | 3-6 months | Building studio, scaling |
| Government | $50-500k | 0% | 6-12 months | Geography-specific |

**SupaSnake recommendation**: Start self-funded → Revenue-funded growth → Publisher/VC if scaling (optional)

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Self-funding = slowest but safest** (keep 100% ownership)
2. **Crowdfunding = validation + capital** (if you have audience)
3. **Publishers = expertise + risk transfer** (if you need marketing)
4. **VC = growth capital** (if you want to build studio, not just ship game)
5. **Grants = free money** (but low odds, long timelines)

**SupaSnake path**: Self-fund MVP → Prove concept → Reinvest revenue → Scale (or stay solo indie)

**Mantra**: "Money is fuel, but shipping is the engine."
