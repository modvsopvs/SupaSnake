# Lens #78: The Lens of Audio

## The Question

**"How does my game sound?"**

## Purpose

Evaluate whether audio design enhances emotional engagement, provides clear feedback, and works within mobile constraints.

## Key Questions

**Audio Clarity**
- Does each sound communicate its purpose clearly?
- Can players distinguish rarity by sound alone?
- Are UI sounds informative without being annoying?

**Emotional Resonance**
- Do sounds create the intended emotional response?
- Does CYBER sound technological and precise?
- Does PRIMAL sound organic and powerful?
- Does COSMIC sound ethereal and mysterious?

**Mobile Considerations**
- Do sounds work with and without headphones?
- Is the game playable in silent mode?
- Are file sizes mobile-appropriate (<50KB per sound)?
- Does audio respect battery constraints?

**Haptic Integration**
- Do haptics complement audio effectively?
- Can deaf/hard-of-hearing players get full feedback?
- Are haptic patterns dynasty-appropriate?

## SupaSnake Application

**Dynasty Audio Identity**
- CYBER: Synthesized tones, digital beeps, glitch effects
- PRIMAL: Drum beats, natural percussion, organic sounds
- COSMIC: Ethereal choir, bells, heavy reverb

**Collection Audio Moments**
- Pull reveal sounds escalate with rarity
- Legendary pulls have memorable 2-second crescendos
- Hatching sounds match dynasty + rarity

**Haptic Feedback**
- Rare pulls trigger strong, satisfying haptic patterns
- Dynasty-specific haptic languages (sharp vs rumbling vs wave)
- Works independently from audio for accessibility

**Mobile Audio Design**
- All sounds 0.5-2 seconds maximum
- Silent mode fully supported with haptics
- Audio mixing prioritizes player actions over ambiance

## Red Flags

- ❌ Sounds annoy after 5 minutes of play
- ❌ Audio breaks immersion or dynasty theme
- ❌ Rare pulls sound less impressive than common
- ❌ Game requires sound to understand feedback
- ❌ File sizes bloat app download
- ❌ Audio processing drains battery

## Success Indicators

- ✅ Legendary pull sound makes players smile
- ✅ Dynasty identity clear from audio alone
- ✅ Players choose to play with sound on
- ✅ Haptic feedback satisfying for deaf players
- ✅ Audio reinforces visual moments perfectly
- ✅ Players share videos with sound

## Audio Testing

**With Sound**
- Do rare moments feel exciting?
- Is dynasty identity clear?
- Are sounds pleasurable, not grating?

**Without Sound (Silent Mode)**
- Is game fully playable?
- Do haptics provide adequate feedback?
- Is nothing lost or confusing?

**With Headphones**
- Do spatial effects enhance experience?
- Is bass satisfying on rare pulls?
- Are quiet sounds audible?

**With Phone Speakers**
- Are sounds still clear?
- Does music work without headphones?
- Are SFX not distorted?
