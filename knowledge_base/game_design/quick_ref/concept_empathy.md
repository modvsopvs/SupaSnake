# Empathy - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (3rd Edition, 2020), Chapters 9-10

## Core Concept

Empathy is the ability to project yourself into another person's perspective, thinking their thoughts and feeling their feelings. Game designers must use empathy to understand players more intimately than players know themselves, designing experiences that satisfy unspoken desires players may not even be consciously aware of.

## Key Points

- **Empathic Projection:** Put yourself in the player's place mentally and physically (Walt Disney crouching to see Disneyland at child height)
- **Automatic Response:** We unconsciously mirror emotions of people we observe (even fictional characters, photos, game avatars)
- **Design Application:** Project yourself into each target demographic to discover what they truly enjoy vs. what they think they want
- **Deep Listening:** Understand players' secret thoughts, emotions, fears, desires—especially those they're unaware of

## Two Empathy Techniques

**1. Memory-Based Empathy:**
- If designing for demographic you were part of (woman designing for teen girls)
- Revive old memories vividly—how you thought, what you liked, how things felt
- Don't forget what it was like (people surprisingly good at forgetting childhood)

**2. Observational Empathy:**
- If designing for demographic you've never been (young man designing for middle-aged women)
- Spend time with target audience like cultural anthropologist
- Observe, talk, imagine what it's like to be them
- Everyone has innate power—practice improves it

## Application to SupaSnake

**Empathizing with Emma (32, Casual):**

**Physical Projection:**
- Play one-handed on bus (thumb controls only)
- Look at screen in bright sunlight (visibility test)
- Get interrupted mid-round (doorbell, text) and resume
- Play before bed while tired (cognitive load test)

**Mental Projection:**
- "I loved Nokia Snake as a teen" (nostalgic connection)
- "I don't have time for complicated games" (simplicity need)
- "I want to see progress for my 5 minutes" (respect-for-time)
- "Energy depleted—I'll check back in 20 minutes" (anticipation, not frustration)

**Design Outcome:** Simplified UI, quick sessions, visible progress, energy as natural stopping point (not paywall).

**Empathizing with Tyler (14, Hardcore):**

**Physical Projection:**
- Long Saturday sessions (30+ min)
- Searching YouTube for "rare variant guide" (discovery hunger)
- Checking leaderboard obsessively (competitive drive)
- Showing friends collection on tablet (social proof)

**Mental Projection:**
- "I want to be first to complete Cyber dynasty" (achievement pride)
- "There must be hidden breeding combos" (discovery obsession)
- "My friend got a legendary, I need one too" (competitive comparison)
- "I figured out the breeding pattern!" (mastery satisfaction)

**Design Outcome:** Deep breeding system, hidden combos, rare variants (0.1% drop), leaderboards, discovery space.

**Einstein's Violin Lesson:** Like Einstein choosing violin over relativity lecture for elderly audience, SupaSnake chooses simple Snake core over complex RPG systems for casual primary audience, while providing depth for those who want it.

## Modern Mobile Context (2020)

**3rd Edition (2020):** Schell emphasizes empathy with diverse audiences, noting games now reach broader demographics than early computer games.

**SupaSnake Specific:** Multi-demographic empathy required:
- **Emma:** Bus rider, parent, time-stressed professional
- **Tyler:** After-school player, discovery-driven completionist
- **Both:** Must feel game "gets them" without alienating the other
