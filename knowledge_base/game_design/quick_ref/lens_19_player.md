# Lens #19: The Lens of the Player

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (3rd Edition, 2020), Chapter 9

## Purpose

Stop thinking about your game and start thinking about your player. Use empathy to project yourself into their perspective, understanding what they like, dislike, expect, and need.

## Questions to Ask

1. **In general, what do they like?**
2. **What don't they like? Why?**
3. **What do they expect to see in a game?**
4. **If I were in their place, what would I want to see in a game?**
5. **What would they like or dislike about my game in particular?**

## How to Use This Lens

**Combined with Lens #10 (Holographic Design):**
Think about player, experience, and mechanics simultaneously. Hold all three perspectives at once.

**Observation Over Assumption:**
Watching players is more valuable than guessing. The more you observe, the better you predict what they'll enjoy.

**Continuous Application:**
Skilled designers are always thinking of the player and advocating for player perspective.

## Application to SupaSnake

**Applying to Emma (32, Casual Mobile Player):**

**1. What does Emma like?**
- Quick, satisfying gameplay (3-5 min sessions)
- Visible progress (collection completion %)
- Nostalgia (Nokia Snake memories)
- Low stress (relaxing escape from work/kids)

**2. What doesn't Emma like? Why?**
- Competitive pressure (stressful, not relaxing)
- Complex tutorials (too much mental overhead)
- Pay-to-win (feels unfair, exploitative)
- Long sessions required (no time available)

**3. What does Emma expect in a mobile game?**
- Free to download, optional purchases
- Play one-handed (thumb controls)
- Pause/resume anytime (interruptions common)
- Quick sessions that fit her schedule

**4. If I were Emma, what would I want?**
- Respect for my limited time (meaningful progress in 5 min)
- Natural stopping points (energy depletion = perfect exit)
- No FOMO (missing daily event doesn't ruin experience)
- Something to look forward to (energy refills, breeding completes)

**5. What would Emma like/dislike about SupaSnake?**

**Like:**
- ✅ Familiar Snake gameplay (instant comfort)
- ✅ Beautiful variants (sensory pleasure)
- ✅ Collection completion (satisfying progress)
- ✅ Energy system (natural sessions)

**Dislike:**
- ❌ Breeding might be too complex (cognitive load)
- ❌ If leaderboards are forced (competitive pressure)

**Design Response:** Make breeding optional, leaderboards opt-in, tutorials clear but brief.

**Applying to Tyler (14, Hardcore Collector):**

**1. What does Tyler like?**
- Deep systems to master (breeding optimization)
- Secrets to discover (hidden rare variants)
- 100% completion goals (full Pokedex satisfaction)
- Competition (leaderboard ranking)

**2. What doesn't Tyler like? Why?**
- Shallow games (boring quickly)
- Pay-to-win (unfair advantage)
- Too easy (no challenge = no pride)
- Missing content (wants "more" always)

**3. What does Tyler expect in a mobile game?**
- Deep progression (not just casual time-waster)
- Competitive features (leaderboards, achievements)
- Discovery space (secrets to find)
- Social proof (show friends collection)

**4. If I were Tyler, what would I want?**
- Endless mastery curve (always improving)
- Rare finds (0.1% drops to hunt)
- Strategic depth (breeding requires planning)
- Bragging rights (top leaderboard, 100% collection)

**5. What would Tyler like/dislike about SupaSnake?**

**Like:**
- ✅ Breeding depth (strategic mastery)
- ✅ Rare variants (hunt challenge)
- ✅ Leaderboards (competitive outlet)
- ✅ Discovery space (hidden combos)

**Dislike:**
- ❌ If breeding is too simple (boredom)
- ❌ If everything is common (no challenge)
- ❌ If no social features (can't show off)

**Design Response:** Deep breeding formulas, 0.1% legendary drops, leaderboards core feature, v0.5 social sharing.

## Walt Disney Example Applied

**Schell's Story:** Walt Disney crouched to child height at Disneyland to see park from children's perspective (different eye height = different experience).

**SupaSnake Parallel:**
- **Emma's "Eye Height":** Bus seat, one-handed phone grip, tired at night, frequently interrupted
- **Test:** Play on bus, interrupt yourself every 2 minutes, play while tired
- **Tyler's "Eye Height":** After-school energy, tablet landscape mode, long Saturday sessions, friend watching over shoulder
- **Test:** Play for 30+ minutes, imagine friend watching, hunt for secrets obsessively

## Tips for Success

✅ **DO:**
- Watch real players from each demographic
- Project yourself physically and mentally into their situation
- Advocate for player perspective in design decisions
- Combine with Lens #10 (Holographic Design)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Design only for yourself (you're not the audience)
- Assume you know what players want without watching them
- Ignore feedback that contradicts your assumptions
