# Autonomy, Competence, Relatedness (Self-Determination Theory) - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (3rd Edition, 2020), Chapter 11

## Core Concept

Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan) proposes humans have exactly three mental needs—**competence** (feeling skilled), **autonomy** (freedom to choose), **relatedness** (connecting with others). These aren't wants but actual psychological needs. When unmet, people become mentally unhealthy. Games excel at fulfilling all three.

## Key Points

- **Competence**: "I need to feel good at something" → Games provide mastery and skill progression
- **Autonomy**: "I need freedom to do things my own way" → Games offer choices and voluntary play
- **Relatedness**: "I need to connect with other people" → Multiplayer creates social bonds
- **Universal Needs**: All three apply to all humans, not personality-dependent
- **Game Alignment**: Games naturally fulfill SDT needs better than most activities, explaining their motivational power

## Application to SupaSnake

**Competence:** Snake skill curve, high scores, breeding mastery, immediate performance feedback

**Autonomy:** Voluntary play (no penalties), dynasty choice, breeding paths, DNA spending freedom, can stop anytime

**Relatedness:** Clans (+4 energy daily), leaderboards, breeding discoveries shared—all asynchronous (no scheduling pressure)

## Modern Mobile Context (2020)

**3rd Edition (2020):** Schell emphasizes SDT's research backing—not speculation but validated psychological theory. Games fulfilling all three needs create healthier, longer-lasting engagement.

**SupaSnake Specific:** Mobile F2P risks undermining autonomy (forced daily login via penalties) and competence (pay-to-win). SupaSnake design protects SDT needs: energy gates create structure without punishment, monetization offers convenience not power, clans add relatedness without coordination burden.

**Both personas served:** Emma prioritizes relatedness/competence, Tyler prioritizes competence/autonomy—different aspects of same game fulfill different need profiles.
