# Ethical Game Design - Quick Reference

**Source:** Schell, Chapter 34 "Responsibility"

## Core Principle

**Game designers shape lives.** With that power comes responsibility to design ethically, respecting players' time, money, mental health, and well-being.

## Ethical Foundations

**The Prime Directive:**
**"First, do no harm."**

Before asking "Is this profitable?" ask "Is this harmful?"

## Key Responsibilities

**1. Respect Player Time:**
- Don't waste it with grinding or artificial delays
- Respect natural stopping points
- No FOMO (fear of missing out) manipulation

**2. Respect Player Money:**
- Transparent pricing (no hidden costs)
- Fair value for purchases
- No predatory spending encouragement
- Spending caps to prevent whaling

**3. Protect Mental Health:**
- Avoid addiction mechanics
- No dark patterns or manipulation
- Build positive, supportive communities
- Moderate toxic behavior

**4. Be Honest:**
- Advertise truthfully
- Show actual gameplay in marketing
- Transparent odds for randomness
- No deceptive practices

## SupaSnake's Ethical Framework

**Energy System Ethics:**
- **Purpose:** Pacing, not gating
- **Cap:** 120 max energy = $6/day spending limit
- **Regeneration:** Free energy every 10 minutes
- **Transparency:** Players see exactly what they're buying
- **Alternative:** Skill-based Classic Mode never costs energy

**Breeding Ethics:**
- **Transparency:** Exact probabilities shown before breeding
- **No Loot Boxes:** Players know possible outcomes upfront
- **Skill Rewarded:** Understanding genetics improves results
- **Fair Odds:** Rare doesn't mean 0.001%, but achievable ~1-5%

**Community Ethics:**
- **No Toxic Incentives:** Leaderboards celebrate skill, not spending
- **Positive Competition:** Friend leaderboards encourage connection
- **Moderation Plans:** Ready to address toxic behavior
- **Privacy:** User data protected, minimal collection

**Monetization Ethics:**
- **Not Pay-to-Win:** Classic Mode is pure skill (free)
- **Fair F2P:** Can complete collections without spending
- **Spending Cap:** Energy system prevents whaling
- **Value Exchange:** Players feel good about purchases

## Red Lines (Never Cross)

**Absolutely Forbidden:**
- Loot boxes with unknown contents
- Psychological manipulation (FOMO, dark patterns)
- Targeting children with monetization
- Hiding true costs
- Encouraging unhealthy play patterns
- Selling player data
- Pay-to-win mechanics

## Questions Before Launch

- Would I be proud if my design was on the front page of the New York Times?
- Would I want my own children to play this?
- Am I treating players how I want to be treated?
- If a player spent $1,000, would I feel good about it?
- Does this design exploit vulnerable players?

**If any answer is "no," redesign.**
