# Lens #9: The Lens of Unification - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (2008), Chapter 5
**SupaSnake Relevance:** CRITICAL

## Core Concept

The Lens of Unification forces you to examine whether every element of your game reinforces your central theme. It's a quality control lens that ensures design coherence by asking if you're using every possible means to strengthen your theme.

## The Two Questions

1. **What is my theme?** (State it clearly and specifically)
2. **Am I using every means possible to reinforce that theme?** (Check every element)

## Application Method

**Step 1:** Use Lens of Elemental Tetrad to separate game elements:
- Technology (platform, engine, tools)
- Mechanics (rules, systems, interactions)
- Story (narrative, characters, world)
- Aesthetics (visuals, audio, feel)

**Step 2:** For each element, ask: "Does this reinforce my theme? If not, why is it here?"

## Application to SupaSnake

**Theme:** "Collection joy meets mastery thrill"

**Technology Check:**
- iOS/Android: ✅ Touch controls perfect for Snake mastery (precision)
- Mobile sessions: ✅ Short runs support "one more try" mastery loop
- Cloud save: ✅ Persistent collection across devices

**Mechanics Check:**
- Snake gameplay: ✅ Pure skill mastery
- DNA collection: ✅ Quantified collection progress
- Breeding combinations: ✅ Discovery extends collection
- Energy system: ⚠️ Does gating reduce mastery feeling? (Test!)

**Story Check:**
- Dynasty system: ✅ Collection has context/meaning
- Variants: ✅ Visual variety makes collection satisfying
- Generations: ✅ Progress narrative

**Aesthetics Check:**
- Visual style: Does it emphasize collection beauty?
- Audio: Does music support mastery flow state?
- UI: Does collection display feel rewarding?
