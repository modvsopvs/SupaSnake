# World Building - Quick Reference

**Source**: The Art of Game Design (Schell), Chapter 19

## Core Concept

A game world is a carefully crafted setting that provides context, meaning, and immersion for gameplay. Effective world building creates coherent, believable spaces where players want to spend time, even in abstract or minimalist games.

## Key Principles

**Coherence Over Realism**
- Worlds must follow internal logic, not reality
- Consistency matters more than accuracy
- Each dynasty (CYBER/PRIMAL/COSMIC) has its own rules

**Meaningful Details**
- Every element should reinforce theme
- Visual details communicate world identity
- Snake variants express dynasty personality

**Player Mental Model**
- Players build expectations from early experience
- Breaking coherence breaks immersion
- Dynasty visual language must be consistent

## SupaSnake Application

**Three Dynasty Worlds:**

| Dynasty | World Identity | Visual Markers | Coherence Rules |
|---------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **CYBER** | Digital/Tech realm | Neon, circuits, data streams | Geometric, clean, glowing |
| **PRIMAL** | Ancient/Nature realm | Organic, scales, natural textures | Earthy, weathered, tribal |
| **COSMIC** | Space/Mystical realm | Stars, nebulae, ethereal glow | Flowing, mysterious, luminous |

**World Building Through:**
- Variant designs (each snake embodies its dynasty)
- Lab backgrounds (CYBER = digital grid, PRIMAL = cave/jungle, COSMIC = starfield)
- UI elements (themed buttons, icons, effects)
- Collection book pages (dynasty-specific layouts)
- Breeding animations (world-appropriate VFX)

**Coherence Checkpoints:**
- Would this design fit in CYBER world? (or PRIMAL/COSMIC)
- Does variant visual match dynasty identity?
- Are UI elements dynasty-consistent?
- Do animations reinforce world theme?

## Quick Facts

- **World = Dynasty**: Each of 3 dynasties is a self-contained thematic world
- **Coherence > Quantity**: Better to have 3 well-defined worlds than 10 unclear ones
- **Visual Language**: Every pixel should reinforce dynasty identity
- **Collection Journey**: Players explore all 3 worlds through breeding

## Design Questions

- What makes CYBER feel "digital" at a glance?
- How do PRIMAL variants look "ancient" without words?
- What visual elements make COSMIC feel "otherworldly"?
- Does every variant clearly belong to its dynasty?

## Common Pitfalls

- Mixing dynasty aesthetics (CYBER snake with tribal patterns)
- Inconsistent visual language within dynasty
- Adding variants that don't fit world identity
- Weak world differentiation (all dynasties look similar)
