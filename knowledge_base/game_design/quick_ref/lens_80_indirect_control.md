# Lens #80: The Lens of Indirect Control - Quick Reference

## The Lens

**Focus Question**: What parts of my game involve direct control vs. indirect control? Which creates better player experience?

**Source**: Schell, Chapter 18 - "Players Don't Always Need Direct Control"

## Key Questions to Ask

### 1. Control Mapping
- Where do players directly control outcomes?
- Where do they influence but not control?
- Is indirect control intentional or accidental?
- Does control level match player expectations?

### 2. Agency vs. Automation
- Do players feel ownership of indirect outcomes?
- Is the relationship between action and result clear?
- Does waiting create anticipation or frustration?
- Can players "understand" the indirect system?

### 3. Accessibility Considerations
- Does indirect control reduce skill barriers?
- Can casual players succeed without twitch skills?
- Does strategic thinking replace execution demands?
- Is the game mobile-friendly due to indirect control?

### 4. Emotional Impact
- Does indirect control create unique emotions?
- Is anticipation valuable (waiting for result)?
- Does surprise enhance or diminish satisfaction?
- Do players enjoy planning more than executing?

## SupaSnake's Control Spectrum

### Direct Control Elements
**Player has immediate, predictable control**:
- **UI Navigation**: Choose which lab to visit
- **Breeding Initiation**: Tap to start breeding
- **Resource Spending**: Decide when to use DNA
- **Dynasty Selection**: Choose which dynasty to pursue

**Emotional Experience**: Confidence, decisiveness

### Indirect Control Elements
**Player influences probabilistic outcomes**:
- **Breeding Results**: Which variant appears (RNG weighted)
- **Rarity Outcomes**: Common/Rare/Epic/Legendary (probabilities)
- **Trait Inheritance**: Which parent traits pass down (formula)
- **Variant Order**: Discovery sequence (partially random)

**Emotional Experience**: Anticipation, surprise, delight (or disappointment)

### Why Indirect Works for SupaSnake

**Mobile Platform Benefits**:
- No twitch skills required (accessibility)
- Asynchronous play supported (breed and wait)
- Low attention demands (strategic, not reactive)
- Touch-friendly (tap to breed, not complex controls)

**Psychological Benefits**:
- Anticipation during breeding animation
- Surprise creates dopamine hits
- Reduced performance anxiety (RNG, not skill failure)
- "Luck" provides emotional cover for setbacks

**Design Benefits**:
- Replayability through variance
- Strategic depth without complexity
- Content variety from same assets
- Progression pacing control

## Design Principles from This Lens

### 1. Make Influence Visible
**Bad**: Breed two snakes, get random result (no logic visible)
**Good**: Show formula, display probabilities (SupaSnake does this)

**Why**: Players need to understand their influence to feel agency

### 2. Balance Randomness
**Too Predictable**: No surprise, boring
**Too Random**: No strategy, frustrating
**SupaSnake Sweet Spot**: Formula-based probabilities + pity system

### 3. Optimize Wait Times
**Breeding Animation**: 2-3 seconds
- Long enough to build anticipation
- Short enough to not frustrate
- Visually interesting (not just loading bar)

**Energy Regeneration**: Hours between sessions
- Matches casual play patterns
- Creates "appointment mechanics"
- Doesn't punish absence (Emma can miss days)

### 4. Provide Course Correction
**Problem**: Indirect control can lead to dead ends
**SupaSnake Solution**: All variants eventually obtainable (no permanent failure)

## Lens Application Decisions

**Decision 1**: Breeding is indirect, not direct selection
- **Alternative Rejected**: "Choose which variant to create"
- **Reasoning**: Indirect creates anticipation + replayability
- **Trade-off**: Frustration risk (mitigated by pity system)

**Decision 2**: RNG weighted by strategy, not pure luck
- **Implementation**: Parent dynasties affect offspring probabilities
- **Reasoning**: Player choices matter (agency)
- **Result**: "My strategy worked!" vs. "I got lucky"

**Decision 3**: Show probabilities (transparency)
- **Implementation**: Display rarity percentages
- **Reasoning**: Informed decisions create ownership
- **Result**: "I knew risks, chose to breed anyway"

**Decision 4**: Immediate feedback on attempt, delayed on outcome
- **Breeding Start**: Instant response (tap confirmed)
- **Breeding Result**: 2-3 second animation
- **Reasoning**: Balance responsiveness with anticipation

## Common Pitfalls (Schell's Warnings)

### Pitfall 1: Too Much Indirection
**Symptom**: Players feel disconnected from outcomes
**Example**: "Breed snake, wait 24 hours, get random result"
**SupaSnake Avoidance**: 2-3 second animation, not 24 hours

### Pitfall 2: Unclear Causality
**Symptom**: Players don't understand why outcomes occur
**Example**: Results seem completely arbitrary
**SupaSnake Avoidance**: Formula visible, probabilities shown

### Pitfall 3: No Strategic Depth
**Symptom**: All choices lead to same outcomes
**Example**: Parent selection doesn't matter
**SupaSnake Avoidance**: Dynasty matching increases targeted rarity odds

### Pitfall 4: Frustration Without Release
**Symptom**: Bad RNG with no recourse
**Example**: 100 breeds without desired variant
**SupaSnake Avoidance**: Pity system guarantees progress

## Emma vs. Tyler Control Preferences

**Emma (Casual, Prefers Indirect)**:
- Loves low-pressure indirect control
- Enjoys surprise over predictability
- "Slot machine" excitement appeals
- Doesn't need to understand exact formulas

**Tyler (Hardcore, Appreciates Strategic Indirect)**:
- Likes planning aspect of indirect control
- Studies formulas to optimize
- Treats probabilities as puzzle to solve
- Masters system through understanding

**Both Satisfied**: Indirect control works for casual AND hardcore (rare design success).

## Red Flags from This Lens

**Warning 1**: Players report feeling "helpless"
- **Diagnosis**: Too much randomness, not enough influence
- **Fix**: Increase strategy impact on probabilities

**Warning 2**: No one talks about "planning" or "strategy"
- **Diagnosis**: Indirect control too shallow
- **Fix**: Add meaningful choices that affect outcomes

**Warning 3**: Breeding feels like "just clicking button"
- **Diagnosis**: Animation too brief, no anticipation
- **Fix**: Extend animation slightly, add tension build-up
