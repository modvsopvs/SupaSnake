**Legacy** (enduring):
- How you changed people
- What you stood for

**Success is measured in months. Legacy is measured in decades.**

## Building Positive Legacy

**Through Design:**

- Innovate meaningfully

**Through Practice:**
- Work sustainably (model healthy practices)

- Challenge exploitation (call out dark patterns)
- Stay true to values (don't compromise ethics)

**Through Community:**

- Build bridges, not walls
- Listen and adapt

## Legacy Mistakes to Avoid

**Chasing Fame Over Impact:**

- "Just this once" dark patterns
- Justifying exploitation
- Following crowd ethically downward
- Prioritizing profit over people

**Burning Bridges:**

**Result:** Negative legacy that haunts career for decades.

## The 100-Year Test

**Imagine someone discovers your game in 100 years:**
- What will they think of you?
- What values will they see?
- What will your design choices say about you?
- Will they be inspired or disappointed?

**SupaSnake in 100 Years:**
- "Early example of ethical mobile F2P"
- "Solo dev who proved integrity works"
- "Transparent probabilities before it was required by law"
- "Respected players when industry didn't"

## Questions to Shape Legacy

1. What do you want to be remembered for?
2. What change do you want to create?
3. Who do you want to help?
4. What do you want to prove?
5. What values do you want to embody?
6. What would you regret NOT doing?
7. What impact matters most to you?

**Your answers define your legacy. Design accordingly.**
