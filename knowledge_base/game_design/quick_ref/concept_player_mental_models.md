# Player Mental Models - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (3rd Edition, 2020), Chapter 10

## Core Concept

Players don't experience reality—they experience simplified mental models of reality that their brains construct. Games leverage this by providing "pre-digested" models (simple rules, clear visuals) that are easier to absorb than the complexity of real life, making gameplay relaxing and satisfying.

## Key Points

- **Reality is Too Complex:** Brains simplify reality into mental models we can understand and manipulate
- **Models Create Illusion:** Everything we experience is a simplified simulation, not reality itself (colors, lines, objects are brain constructs)
- **Games Are Pre-Digested Models:** Games provide simplified rule sets that match our internal modeling perfectly, reducing cognitive load
- **Why This Matters:** Players relax when playing because games require less mental work than real world complexity

## Application to SupaSnake

**Emma's Mental Model (Casual):**
- Snake = "Nostalgic Nokia game" (simple, familiar model)
- Collection Lab = "Panini sticker book" (completion satisfaction)
- DNA = "Points I collect to unlock things" (simple resource model)
- Energy = "Play sessions available" (natural stopping point, not punishment)

**Tyler's Mental Model (Hardcore):**
- Snake = "Skill-based arcade challenge" (mastery opportunity)
- Breeding Lab = "Pokémon genetics system" (strategic depth)
- Dynasties = "Pokémon types with unique properties" (discovery space)
- Variants = "Collectible creatures with stats and rarities" (RPG framework)

**Design Implication:** SupaSnake supports BOTH mental models simultaneously:
- Surface layer matches Emma's simple model (collect, complete, nostalgic fun)
- Depth layer matches Tyler's complex model (breed, optimize, master)

## Modern Mobile Context (2020)

**3rd Edition (2020):** Schell uses Charlie Brown cartoon as example of how simplified "lines" match our brain's internal visual processing, making cartoons soothing to look at.

**SupaSnake Specific:** Mobile UI uses clean vector graphics, bold colors, clear lines—matching players' internal visual models perfectly. Reduces cognitive load during short, interrupted sessions (Emma's bus commute). Variant designs are "cartoon snakes" not photorealistic—easier to process and categorize mentally.
