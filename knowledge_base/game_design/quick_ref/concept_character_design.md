# Character Design - Quick Reference

**Source**: The Art of Game Design (Schell), Chapter 20

## Core Concept

Great characters are more than visual designs - they are personalities that players connect with emotionally. In SupaSnake, variants are collectible characters that express personality through appearance, behavior, and implied backstory.

## Key Principles

**Character Functions:**
1. **Avatar**: Player's representation (your snake collection)
2. **Ideal**: Who player aspires to be (legendary variants)
3. **Personality**: Distinct identities (each variant has character)

**Character Traits:**
- **Visual**: Instantly recognizable silhouette and colors
- **Behavioral**: How they move, react, appear
- **Backstory**: Implied history and meaning (even without dialogue)
- **Relatability**: Players see themselves or aspirations in character

## SupaSnake Character System

**Variants as Characters:**
- Each snake variant = unique character
- No dialogue, but strong personality through design
- Collection = building relationships with characters
- Breeding = creating new character combinations

**Character Hierarchy:**

| Tier | Character Role | Player Relationship | Design Approach |
|------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Common** | Familiar companions | "My first snakes" | Approachable, friendly designs |
| **Uncommon** | Interesting friends | "Getting serious" | More distinct personalities |
| **Rare** | Special allies | "Real achievements" | Striking, memorable designs |
| **Epic** | Aspirational heroes | "Dream snakes" | Dramatic, powerful presence |
| **Legendary** | Ultimate ideals | "Life goals" | Awe-inspiring, iconic status |

## Design Strategies

**Appealing Characters (Schell's Principles):**

1. **Simple Silhouette**
   - Recognizable from shadow alone
   - Clear, readable shape
   - Example: Serpent King has distinct crown/horns in silhouette

2. **Exaggerated Features**
   - Amplify personality traits
   - Make distinctive elements larger/more prominent
   - Example: CYBER variants have oversized tech elements

3. **Expressive Details**
   - Eyes, patterns, accessories communicate emotion
   - Small details reveal personality
   - Example: PRIMAL variants have tribal markings that suggest history

4. **Color Psychology**
   - Colors convey personality before conscious thought
   - Dynasty colors set emotional tone
   - Example: COSMIC variants use mysterious purples/deep blues

5. **Purposeful Proportions**
   - Cute = large head, small body
   - Powerful = large body, small head
   - Adjust to desired player response

**Character Personality Expression:**

**Visual Personality:**
- **Aggressive**: Sharp angles, bold colors, spikes, intense eyes
- **Mysterious**: Flowing forms, shadowy elements, hidden features
- **Friendly**: Rounded shapes, bright colors, open expressions
- **Ancient**: Weathered textures, tribal patterns, earthy tones
- **Futuristic**: Clean lines, glowing elements, tech details

**Behavioral Personality:**
- **Idle animations**: Curious variants look around, lazy ones rest
- **Movement style**: Sleek variants glide, powerful ones coil/strike
- **Breeding response**: Eager variants appear excited, rare ones seem reluctant
- **Collection display**: How variant presents itself in gallery

## Character Archetypes in Dynasties

**CYBER Dynasty Characters:**
- **The Innovator**: Cutting-edge, experimental designs
- **The Enforcer**: Militaristic, security-focused variants
- **The Networker**: Social, connected, data-stream aesthetics
- **The Ghost**: Mysterious, glitch-like, partially visible

**PRIMAL Dynasty Characters:**
- **The Warrior**: Battle-scarred, fierce, powerful
- **The Shaman**: Mystical markings, wise appearance
- **The Hunter**: Sleek, predatory, focused
- **The Ancient**: Weathered, timeless, venerable

**COSMIC Dynasty Characters:**
- **The Starborn**: Celestial, pristine, ethereal
- **The Mystic**: Enigmatic, symbol-covered, transcendent
- **The Wanderer**: Distant, contemplative, nebulous
- **The Ascended**: Radiant, evolved, god-like

## Designing Memorable Characters

**The Character Sheet (Per Variant):**
- **Name**: What is this character called?
- **Personality**: 3-5 adjectives describing character
- **Visual Hook**: What makes them instantly recognizable?
- **Dynasty Role**: How do they fit in their world?
- **Player Appeal**: Why would player want this character?
- **Backstory Implication**: What's their suggested history?

**Example - "Serpent King" (PRIMAL Legendary):**
- **Name**: Serpent King (implies authority, ancient lineage)
- **Personality**: Regal, powerful, wise, commanding, timeless
- **Visual Hook**: Crown-like horns, royal patterns, imposing size
- **Dynasty Role**: PRIMAL dynasty leader/patriarch
- **Player Appeal**: Ultimate achievement, status symbol, collection centerpiece
- **Backstory**: Ancient ruler of serpent kind, survived eons

## Character Relationships

**Breeding as Relationship:**
- Parents pass traits to offspring (genetic + emotional connection)
- Players develop attachment through breeding investment
- Hybrid children represent uniting of different character personalities
- Family trees create narrative connections

**Collection as Community:**
- Gallery = player's character roster
- Completing dynasties = assembling complete "cast"
- Rare variants = prized team members
- Missing variants = characters to pursue

## Quick Facts

- **Silent Characters**: SupaSnake variants have no dialogue but strong personality
- **Visual Storytelling**: Every design choice communicates character
- **Player Projection**: Players assign meaning and relationships to their snakes
- **Character Progression**: Breeding creates character development through generations

## Design Questions

- What personality does this variant express at first glance?
- Would player recognize this variant's silhouette alone?
- What emotional response does this design evoke?
- How is this character different from similar variants?
- Why would player form attachment to this character?

## Common Pitfalls

- Generic designs without personality (just "a snake")
- Overcomplicated visuals that muddy character identity
- Inconsistent personality between design and behavior
- Missing emotional hook (players don't care)
- Indistinct from other variants in same tier
