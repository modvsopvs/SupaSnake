# Future Team Planning - Quick Reference

**When to Grow**: Only when solo dev is consistently overwhelmed AND revenue supports hiring. For most mobile games, this is 6-12 months post-launch, if ever.

## Hiring Triggers (Wait for All Three)

1. **Revenue Threshold**: $5,000+/month consistent for 3+ months
2. **Time Bottleneck**: Consistently working 50+ hours/week, still can't keep up
3. **Clear Role Need**: Specific, recurring work that can't be automated

**Don't Hire Because**:
- "It would be nice to have help" (costs > benefits)
- Community suggests it (they don't see your finances)
- Competitor has bigger team (they may have funding you don't)

## First Hire: Artist/Content Creator (NOT Engineer)

**Why Artist First**:
- Frees developer to focus on code (highest value work)
- Art is hardest to automate (code can use Copilot, art needs human taste)
- Content pipeline is clear (new variants every month)
- Part-time/contract work possible (20 hours/month)

**Cost**: $1,000-2,000/month for part-time contractor

**Deliverables**:
- 5 new snake variants per month (Midjourney + 3D polish)
- Promotional art for social media
- UI polish (icons, backgrounds)

## Second Hire: Community Manager (NOT Engineer #2)

**When**: 10,000+ active players, 500+ Discord members, moderation taking 10+ hours/week

**Why Community Manager**:
- Developer burnout from dual coding + moderation
- Community engagement drives retention more than new features at scale
- Frees developer for deep work blocks

**Cost**: $2,000-3,000/month for part-time (20-30 hours/week)

**Deliverables**:
- Daily Discord moderation (respond within 1 hour)
- Weekly community event (breeding competition, screenshot contest)
- Monthly player survey + feedback report to developer
- Social media management (Twitter/Reddit posts)

## Third Hire: Engineer (Finally!)

**When**: Codebase blocking new features, major refactor needed, OR multiplayer/backend work overwhelming

**Why Engineer Third**:
- Solo dev got this far alone - code is least urgent bottleneck
- Onboarding engineers is expensive (weeks of ramp-up, context transfer)
- Only hire when technical debt crisis, not for "nice to have" features

**Cost**: $4,000-8,000/month for part-time contractor (or profit-share equity deal)

**Deliverables**:
- Backend systems (multiplayer, server infrastructure)
- Platform ports (Android if launched iOS-only, or vice versa)
- Major refactors (physics rewrite, database migration)

## Team Structure at 2-3 People

**Developer (You)** - 40 hours/week:
- Core gameplay systems (breeding, progression, economy)
- Technical direction (architecture, tools)
- Final say on all decisions

**Artist (Contractor)** - 20 hours/month:
- New variants (5 per month)
- UI polish
- Marketing art

**Community Manager (Part-Time)** - 20 hours/week:
- Discord/Reddit moderation
- Weekly events
- Player feedback synthesis

**Total Cost**: $3,000-5,000/month

## Collaboration Tools (Lightweight)

**Communication**:
- **Discord** - Private team channel (free)
- **Loom** - Async video updates (free tier)
- **Weekly Sync** - 30-minute video call (Google Meet, free)

**Project Management**:
- **GitHub Projects** - Shared board (free)
- **Notion** - Shared docs (free tier)
- **Avoid**: Jira, Asana, Linear - too heavyweight for 3-person team

**Asset Sharing**:
- **Google Drive** - Art files (free 15GB)
- **Git LFS** - Large game assets (free with GitHub)

## Communication Patterns

**Async by Default**:
- Use Loom videos for context (5-minute walkthroughs > 30-minute meetings)
- Write decision docs in Notion (everyone can read on their time)
- Pull requests with detailed descriptions (no surprise code drops)

**Weekly Sync (30 Minutes)**:
- What shipped last week?
- What's blocking you?
- What's the priority this week?
- Quick decisions on small items

**No Daily Standups** - Overhead too high for small team

## Equity vs. Cash Compensation

**Contractor (Cash)**:
- Best for artist, community manager
- Clear deliverables, limited scope
- No long-term commitment needed

**Co-Founder (Equity)**:
- Only for engineer joining pre-revenue or pre-launch
- 10-25% equity for equal commitment
- Vesting over 4 years (1-year cliff)
- Use lawyer for formal agreement ($1,000-2,000 one-time)

**Hybrid (Cash + Equity)**:
- Engineer gets $3,000/month + 5-10% equity
- Reduces cash burn, aligns incentives
- Still use vesting schedule

## Red Flags (Bad Hires)

❌ **Hiring Friends/Family** - Mixing personal + professional relationships rarely works
❌ **Hiring Too Early** - Burning cash before product-market fit found
❌ **Hiring "Ideas Person"** - Solo dev doesn't need more ideas, needs execution
❌ **Hiring Generalist** - "I can do art, code, and marketing!" usually means mediocre at all three
❌ **Equity-Only Deals** - "Work for free, we'll make millions!" never works

## When NOT to Hire (Stay Solo)

**Stay Solo If**:
- Revenue < $5,000/month (can't afford payroll)
- Working 40 hours/week comfortably (no time bottleneck)
- Enjoying solo dev freedom (no management overhead)
- Product-market fit uncertain (too risky to commit cash)

**Solo dev is viable long-term** - many successful mobile games are 1-person teams for years.
