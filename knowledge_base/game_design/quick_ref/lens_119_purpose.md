# Lens #119: Your Purpose - Quick Reference

**Source:** Schell, Chapter 35 "Your Purpose"

## The Lens

**To use this lens, ask yourself:**

- Why am I making this game?
- What impact do I want to have on those who play it?
- What impact do I want to have on the world at large?
- How does this game align with my purpose as a designer?
- What would make me abandon this project?
- What would make me proudest about this project?

## Purpose

**This lens helps you clarify your deepest motivations and ensure your work serves your purpose, not just external pressures.**

## Application to SupaSnake

**Why Am I Making This Game?**
- Build sustainable indie career creating ethical mobile games
- Prove you don't need dark patterns to succeed financially
- Develop professional skills (React Native, F2P design, mobile dev)
- Create portfolio piece I'm proud to show for rest of career
- Transform casual players into strategic thinkers
- Eventually mentor other indie developers

**Impact on Players:**
- Discover they enjoy strategic depth in mobile games
- Learn resource management, probability, long-term planning
- Find welcoming community around shared interest
- Experience mobile game that respects their time and money
- Have fun and reduce stress through engaging gameplay

**Impact on World:**
- Raise standards for ethical mobile F2P
- Inspire other indie devs to build without dark patterns
- Demonstrate solo dev can compete ethically
- Add positive example to mobile gaming landscape
- Share learnings openly to help others

**Alignment with Designer Purpose:**
- ✅ Ethical monetization (core purpose)
- ✅ Sustainable solo dev scope (health/career)
- ✅ Skill development (professional growth)
- ✅ Player transformation (positive impact)
- ✅ Open knowledge sharing (eventual mentorship)

**Would Make Me Abandon Project:**
- Having to add dark patterns for profitability
- Becoming unsustainable health-wise or financially
- Realizing it's harming players
- Losing all joy in the work
- Compromising core ethical values

**Would Make Me Proudest:**
- Players saying SupaSnake changed how they think about mobile games
- Other indie devs citing SupaSnake as ethical F2P inspiration
- Achieving profitability while maintaining ethics
- Building positive, welcoming community
- Shipping polished game solo in sustainable way

## Purpose-Driven Decisions

**Past Decisions Aligned with Purpose:**
- Energy cap instead of unlimited whaling → Ethical monetization
- Breeding probabilities shown upfront → Transparency over loot box profits
- Classic Mode skill-based leaderboard → Fair competition over P2W
- Solo-sustainable scope → Health over overpromising
- Open documentation → Future mentorship foundation

**Future Decisions Guided by Purpose:**
- Multiplayer features? → Only if maintains ethics, doesn't require unsustainable scope
- Expanding to other platforms? → If serves skill development without burnout
- Taking publisher deal? → Only if maintains creative control and ethics
- Adding ads? → Only if non-intrusive and ethical (probably no)

## When Purpose is Challenged

**Common Challenges:**
- Low revenue → "Maybe add loot boxes?"
  - **Purpose Response:** My purpose is proving ethical works, not getting rich quick

- Peer pressure → "You're leaving money on the table"
  - **Purpose Response:** My purpose values player respect over maximum extraction

- Competitor success → "They use FOMO timers..."
  - **Purpose Response:** My purpose is raising standards, not copying exploitative practices

- Burnout risk → "Should I work nights and weekends?"
  - **Purpose Response:** My purpose includes sustainable career, not burning out

**Purpose keeps you on track when pressures mount.**

## Purpose Evolution

"Build ethical mobile F2P game that proves respectful monetization works while developing professional skills and creating positive player experiences."

**Purpose in 10 Years:**

## Daily Purpose Check

**Before starting work:**
