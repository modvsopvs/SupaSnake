# Lens #11: The Lens of Infinite Inspiration - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (2008), Chapter 6
**SupaSnake Relevance:** HIGH

## Core Concept

Don't seek inspiration from other games—look everywhere else. The juggler who studied ballet, geese, and machinery created unique moves others couldn't copy because his inspiration sources were unique. Your experiences in life become unique game design elements when captured and translated into mechanics, aesthetics, story, or technology.

## The Two Questions

1. **What is an experience I have had in my life that I would want to share with others?**
2. **In what small way can I capture the essence of that experience and put it into my game?**

## Key Principle

"Don't look to other jugglers for inspiration—look everywhere else." Others can copy your moves, but they can't copy your inspiration. Unique sources = unique designs.

## Application Method

**Step 1:** Stop looking at similar games
**Step 2:** Look at real-world experiences you've had
**Step 3:** Ask: What was the ESSENCE of that experience?
**Step 4:** Find a small way to capture it in your game

## Application to SupaSnake

**Real-Life Experiences to Mine:**

**Collecting stickers as a child:**
- Essence: The hunt for missing numbers, the satisfaction of completion, showing your collection to friends
- Capture: Collection Lab pages, completion bonuses, variant showcase system

**The flow of mastering a skill (any skill):**
- Essence: That moment when you "get it," when muscle memory takes over, when you achieve beyond your previous best
- Capture: Snake controls that reward practice, generation progression that quantifies improvement, variant unlocks as mastery trophies

**Breeding combinations (gardening, color mixing, cooking experiments):**
- Essence: Anticipation of what you'll create, surprise at unexpected results, pride in rare outcomes
- Capture: Dynasty breeding mechanics with inheritance rules, rare variant discoveries

**Non-Game Inspirations to Explore:**
- Stamp collecting (rarity tiers, provenance)
- Muscle memory in music/sports (practice payoff)
- Genealogy (family trees, inheritance)
- Natural history museums (specimen collections)
