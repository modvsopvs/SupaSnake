## The Lens

**"Different isn't always better, but better is always different."** —Scotty Meltzer

To ensure you harness the powerful motivation of novelty, ask yourself these questions:

- **What is novel about my game?**
- **Does my game have novelties throughout or just at the beginning?**
- **Do I have the right mix of the novel and the familiar?**
- **When the novelty wears off, will players still enjoy my game?**

## Core Insight

Human thirst for novelty drives game purchases and session engagement. Novelty that makes you "think in a whole new way" (like Portal's portal mechanic) is especially powerful. But novelty alone isn't enough—when it wears off, there must be substance beneath. Every successful game mixes novel and familiar.

## Application to SupaSnake

**Initial Novelty (Acquisition Hook):**
- **Hybrid Genre**: Snake + collection game (novel combination of familiar genres)
- **Breeding Mechanics**: Combine dynasties to create variants (Pokemon meets Snake)
- **Energy Scarcity**: Snake as valuable limited resource (reverses endless Snake paradigm)

**Sustained Novelty (Retention):**
- **Monthly Dynasties**: New dynasty every month (continuous novelty stream)
- **Variant Discoveries**: 10 variants per dynasty (novelty within familiar collection loop)
- **Breeding Combinations**: New genetic possibilities with each dynasty (novelty through permutation)
- **Tower Mode (v0.5)**: New gameplay variation after Classic mastery

**Novel + Familiar Balance:**
- **Familiar**: Core Snake controls (everyone knows Snake)
- **Novel**: Collection context changes Snake's meaning (not endless, but resource-generating)
- **Familiar**: Panini sticker book psychology (proven collection model)
- **Novel**: Apply collection to Snake performance (unusual pairing)

**Post-Novelty Substance:**
- Snake mastery remains intrinsically fun (skill progression)
- Collection completion satisfies completionist drive
- Breeding optimization deepens (meta-game emerges)

**Balance Check:** Novel enough to stand out (hybrid genre), familiar enough to understand (Snake + collecting), substantive enough when novelty fades (skill-based core).
