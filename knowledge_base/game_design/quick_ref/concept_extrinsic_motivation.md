# Extrinsic Motivation - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (3rd Edition, 2020), Chapter 11

## Core Concept

Extrinsic motivation comes from outside—you do something for external rewards, payments, or to avoid punishment. It's the "hafta" that drives obligated behavior. While often maligned, extrinsic motivation can work synergistically with intrinsic motivation when designed carefully.

## Key Points

- **Definition**: Doing something for external rewards, not for enjoyment of the activity itself
- **External Source**: Points, prizes, social pressure, avoiding penalties
- **Not Always Bad**: Can create initial engagement that grows into intrinsic enjoyment (the "trellis and vine" effect)
- **Danger**: Over-reliance shifts activities from pleasure-seeking to pain-avoidance ("people don't stop playing F2P games, they divorce them")
- **Complexity**: Can interact with intrinsic motivation in unexpected ways—sometimes amplifying, sometimes draining it

## Application to SupaSnake

**Extrinsic Drivers in SupaSnake:**
- **DNA Rewards**: Tangible currency for Snake performance (points system)
- **Collection Completion**: Panini book psychology—visual progress bars (7/10 CYBER variants)
- **Set Bonuses**: +10% DNA income for completing dynasties (permanent rewards)
- **Leaderboards**: Social comparison and status (Emma persona)
- **Daily Refills**: Time-gated rewards create return obligation

**Risk**: If extrinsic rewards dominate, SupaSnake becomes "hafta"—daily check-in chore instead of fun game. Emma might feel pressured by clan bonuses, Tyler might resent energy gates interrupting flow state.

## Modern Mobile Context (2020)

**3rd Edition (2020):** Schell discusses F2P trap—games start pleasure-seeking (bonuses, rewards) but gradually build obligations (return by deadline or lose points), sliding toward pain-avoidance.

**SupaSnake Specific:** Energy system balances scarcity (extrinsic pressure) with voluntary play (intrinsic fun). Daily refills are generous (22-26 energy F2P) to avoid "forced login" feeling. Monetization offers *convenience* (more runs today) not power (better Snake performance).
