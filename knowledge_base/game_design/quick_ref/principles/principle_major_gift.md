# The Major Gift: Love Over Talent - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (2008), Chapter 1

## Core Concept

There are two kinds of gifts for game design. The **minor gift** is innate skill—design comes naturally and easily to you. The **major gift** is love of the work—you design games because you must, because it makes your heart sing. The major gift trumps the minor gift because love drives practice, and practice builds skill. Someone with only minor gift may be naturally talented but won't push through failures or tedious balancing. Someone with the major gift will design using limited skills, keep practicing, and eventually surpass the naturally talented. Your work glows with "an indescribable quality" when made with love—audiences feel this even if they can't articulate it. The path to mastery: start designing, see if it makes your heart sing, and never stop.

## Key Points

- **Minor gift = innate skill**: Design feels easy, comes naturally—but you may not enjoy doing it
- **Major gift = love of work**: You design because you love it, even when it's hard
- **Love enables growth**: Practice (driven by love) builds skill; talent without practice stagnates
- **Love shows in work**: Games made with love have an "indescribable glow" that resonates with players
- **Only one way to know**: Start designing and see if it makes your heart sing

## Application to SupaSnake

Mobile game development is brutally competitive—thousands of Snake clones exist, and most fail. The major gift is your differentiator.

**Why SupaSnake might work**: You're combining Snake (proven) + collection (Panini psychology) + breeding (Pokémon depth) because **you love the idea**. That love shows in:
- **Attention to variants**: You could ship 3 snakes and call it done, but you're designing dynasties with lore and generation mechanics
- **Persistence through failure**: Your first energy system might kill retention—major gift means you iterate, minor gift means you quit
- **Joy in details**: The moment you realize a "Crystal Dynasty" snake glows differently when it eats—that's love, and players feel it

**Checking for the major gift**:
- **Do you play mobile games for fun, or obligation?** If obligation, you might lack the major gift for mobile design
- **Do you think about SupaSnake when not working?** Random shower thoughts about balance = major gift
- **Does balancing DNA costs bore or fascinate you?** If fascinated, you have the gift; if bored, delegate it

**SupaSnake-specific test**: Spend 4 hours tweaking breeding RNG percentages. If you emerge energized ("I made it feel *right*!"), you have the major gift. If you emerge drained ("Finally done with this tedium"), you're designing with minor gift alone.

**Remember**: Players can't articulate why they prefer SupaSnake over "Snake.io Clone #47," but they'll feel the difference. Your love for the work is the difference.
