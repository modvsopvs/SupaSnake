# Five Kinds of Listening - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (2008), Chapter 1

## Core Concept

Game designers must master five distinct listening modes, each aimed at a different source of truth. **Team**: Your collaborators hold skills you lack—listen to function as one unit. **Audience**: They decide if your game succeeds—listen to know them better than they know themselves. **Game**: Like a mechanic hearing engine trouble, listen to your game's feedback to diagnose issues. **Client**: They fund your work—listen to discover what they truly want beyond their stated requirements. **Self**: Your instincts and creativity—the hardest but most powerful listening mode. These five modes are interconnected; mastering them means weaving between them fluidly throughout the design process.

## Key Points

- **Team listening**: Share skills across disciplines, resolve miscommunication, function as one brain
- **Audience listening**: Study players in their habitat, discover their heart's desire, validate assumptions
- **Game listening**: Observe the game "running" like machinery, detect what's broken or unbalanced
- **Client listening**: Decode true needs from stated wants, align vision with business reality
- **Self listening**: Trust your instincts, examine your feelings, unlock creativity through introspection

## Application to SupaSnake

As a mobile indie developer, you may wear multiple hats (designer, programmer, marketer), making listening even more critical because you're often your own team, client, and first audience.

**Listening to Your Team** (even if it's just you):
- Solo dev: Listen to different "roles" in your mind—designer-you vs. programmer-you may disagree on breeding complexity
- Small team: When your artist says "the variant sprites are done," listen for hesitation—maybe they're rushed, not polished

**Listening to Your Audience**:
- Analytics: 80% of players never try Classic Mode—listen: "Core Snake is too hard or poorly tutorialized"
- Reddit comments: "SupaSnake is chill" (positive) but "no reason to grind DNA" (problem: collection lacks urgency)

**Listening to Your Game**:
- Play 10 rounds without breaks—does DNA income (20 DNA/minute) feel rewarding or tedious?
- Watch a stranger play—when do they pause, frown, or smile? Your game is "speaking" through their reactions

**Listening to Your Client** (App Store algorithms, monetization model):
- App Store wants high Day-1 retention → listen: Tutorial must hook instantly, not in 5 minutes
- F2P model wants 2-5% conversion → listen: Energy gates must feel fair, not exploitative

**Listening to Your Self**:
- You feel excited designing dynasties but bored balancing DNA costs—listen: hire/delegate balance, focus on your strength
- You play your own game for fun—listen: you've captured something special; double down on that essence
