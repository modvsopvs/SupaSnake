# Confidence in Game Design - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (2008), Chapter 1

## Core Concept

Game design requires decisive confidence built through the mantra "I am a game designer." Doubt is inevitable—novices fear inexperience, experienced designers fear their skills are narrow, veterans worry they've lost their touch—but these thoughts are useless. Confidence comes not from eliminating doubt but from pushing forward despite it, making decisions boldly even when uncertain. The path to mastery is paved with failures: "If you aren't failing, you aren't trying hard enough, and you aren't really a game designer."

## Key Points

- **Magic words work**: Saying "I am a game designer" out loud builds confidence through pretense becoming reality
- **Doubt is universal**: Every designer at every level faces confidence crises—this never goes away
- **Fear of ridicule blocks innovation**: Great creative minds share one trait—they lack fear of being laughed at
- **Failure is the path**: You'll fail far more than you succeed, but each failure teaches and brings you closer to excellence
- **Decisive action required**: Game design is decision-making; indecision kills momentum and creative flow

## Application to SupaSnake

As a solo or small-team mobile developer, confidence matters even more than in large studios. When designing SupaSnake's Collection Lab, you must decide: "Do players unlock variants by spending DNA or by completing challenges?" There's no committee to validate your choice. Build confidence by:

- **Declaring it**: "I am designing a mobile Snake game with Pokémon-style collection"—own this vision
- **Embracing failure**: Your first energy system might feel stingy or too generous—that's data, not defeat
- **Moving decisively**: The breeding formula won't perfect itself through deliberation—implement, test, iterate
- **Trusting your instincts**: When playtesting feels off, you often know why before analytics confirm it

**SupaSnake Context**: You're creating something new (Snake + collection + dynasties). No proven playbook exists. Confidence lets you make the 1,000 micro-decisions required daily: spawn rates, UI placement, tutorial flow, monetization gates. Hesitation compounds; decisiveness compounds faster.
