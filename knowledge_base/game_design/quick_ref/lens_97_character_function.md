# Lens #97: The Lens of Character Function - Quick Reference

**Source**: The Art of Game Design (Schell), Chapter 20

## The Lens

**Focus**: What purposes do characters serve in the game?

**Ask Yourself:**
- What functions does this character fulfill?
- Could this character be replaced by a simpler element?
- Are all character functions being used effectively?
- Does character design support its function?

## Character Functions (Schell)

1. **Avatar**: Player's representation in world
2. **Information Source**: Provides game knowledge
3. **Goal Object**: Something to pursue or achieve
4. **Obstacle**: Challenge to overcome
5. **Spectacle**: Entertainment to watch
6. **Mirror**: Reflects player's choices/values

## SupaSnake Character Functions

**Variants Serve Multiple Functions:**

**Function 1: Goal Objects**
- **Primary Role**: Variants are collection objectives
- **Implementation**: Players pursue specific variants to complete collection
- **Design Support**: Rarity tiers create aspiration ladder (common → legendary)
- **Example**: "I need Serpent King to complete PRIMAL dynasty"

**Function 2: Spectacle**
- **Role**: Variants are beautiful/cool things to look at and show off
- **Implementation**: Idle animations, breeding reveals, collection gallery display
- **Design Support**: High visual quality, dynasty-specific aesthetics, impressive legendaries
- **Example**: "Check out my holographic COSMIC legendary!"

**Function 3: Information Source**
- **Role**: Variants teach players about dynasties through visual design
- **Implementation**: CYBER variants look tech, PRIMAL look natural, COSMIC look mystical
- **Design Support**: Clear visual language, consistent dynasty themes
- **Example**: "All these tech-looking snakes must be CYBER dynasty"

**Function 4: Mirror**
- **Role**: Collection reflects player's choices, efforts, and values
- **Implementation**: Breeding decisions, variant preferences, completion strategy
- **Design Support**: Multiple paths to completion, player choice matters
- **Example**: Emma loves cute variants, Tyler pursues rare/legendary status symbols

**Function 5: Progress Marker**
- **Role**: Variants represent achievement and advancement
- **Implementation**: Rarer variants = more time/effort invested
- **Design Support**: Tiered rarity system, breeding complexity, DNA costs
- **Example**: "I finally bred an Epic after 20 attempts!"

## Functional Design Per Rarity

**Common Variants:**
- **Function**: Early goals, teaching tools, breeding foundation
- **Design**: Approachable, clear dynasty identity, simple but appealing
- **Example**: Basic CYBER snake with clean circuit patterns

**Uncommon Variants:**
- **Function**: Mid-tier goals, collection progress, personality variety
- **Design**: More distinctive personality, interesting visual hooks
- **Example**: PRIMAL snake with unique tribal markings

**Rare Variants:**
- **Function**: Significant achievements, memorable spectacles
- **Design**: Bold visual statements, strong personality, impressive details
- **Example**: COSMIC snake with flowing nebula patterns

**Epic Variants:**
- **Function**: Major accomplishments, aspiration targets, showpieces
- **Design**: Dramatic presence, complex designs, awe-inspiring
- **Example**: CYBER snake with elaborate holographic effects

**Legendary Variants:**
- **Function**: Ultimate goals, status symbols, collection centerpieces
- **Design**: Iconic, god-tier presence, worth hours of pursuit
- **Example**: Serpent King - ancient ruler, commanding presence

## Functional Analysis Questions

**For Each Variant:**

**Goal Object Function:**
- Is this variant worth pursuing? (visual appeal + rarity)
- Does difficulty match perceived value?
- What makes player WANT this variant?

**Spectacle Function:**
- Is this fun to look at?
- Does idle animation enhance appeal?
- Would player show this to friends?

**Information Function:**
- Can player identify dynasty from design?
- Does visual teach about game world?
- Is dynasty theme clear?

**Mirror Function:**
- Does collecting this reflect player skill/dedication?
- Do breeding choices matter for getting this variant?
- Does variant represent player's achievement?

**Progress Marker Function:**
- Does rarity accurately reflect difficulty?
- Does unlocking this feel like advancement?
- Is this a meaningful milestone?

## Multi-Function Design

**Best Variants Serve Multiple Functions Simultaneously:**

**Example: "Serpent King" (PRIMAL Legendary)**

✅ **Goal Object**: Ultimate PRIMAL dynasty target, drives long-term play
✅ **Spectacle**: Majestic design, impressive animations, gallery centerpiece
✅ **Information**: Clearly PRIMAL (tribal crown, natural power, ancient vibe)
✅ **Mirror**: Represents Tyler's mastery, Emma's dedication
✅ **Progress Marker**: Unlocking = completing PRIMAL dynasty journey

**Design Elements Supporting Functions:**
- Crown/horns → Goal Object (looks valuable, worthy pursuit)
- Royal patterns → Spectacle (beautiful, shows well)
- Tribal aesthetic → Information (obviously PRIMAL dynasty)
- Legendary rarity → Mirror (player skill/commitment)
- 6-12 hour pursuit → Progress Marker (significant achievement)

## Functional Failure Points

**Character Doesn't Serve Clear Function:**
❌ Variant that's neither appealing nor challenging (no goal value)
❌ Boring design that's no fun to look at (no spectacle value)
❌ Confusing dynasty identity (no information value)
❌ Too easy or too random to obtain (no mirror/progress value)

**Function-Design Mismatch:**
❌ Common rarity but legendary-tier design (confusing value)
❌ Legendary rarity but boring design (doesn't justify pursuit)
❌ Dynasty-unclear visuals (fails information function)
❌ No personality (fails spectacle and goal functions)

## Quick Facts

- **Every Variant = Multiple Functions**: Goal + Spectacle + Information + Mirror + Progress
- **Design Must Support Function**: Legendary rarity needs legendary design
- **Function Clarity**: Player should understand variant's role/value at glance
- **No Purposeless Variants**: Each variant should justify its existence through clear functions

## Design Process

**When Creating New Variant:**

1. **Define Functions**: What purposes will this variant serve?
2. **Prioritize**: Which function is most important? (Usually Goal + Spectacle)
3. **Design for Function**: Visual choices support intended functions
4. **Test Functions**: Does design actually fulfill intended purposes?
5. **Refine**: Enhance weak functions, emphasize strong ones

**Example - Designing New CYBER Epic:**

1. **Functions**:
   - Primary: Goal (players want to collect this)
   - Secondary: Spectacle (impressive to look at)
   - Support: Information (teaches CYBER identity)

2. **Design Decisions**:
   - **For Goal Function**: Make visually appealing, challenging but fair to breed
   - **For Spectacle Function**: Holographic effects, sleek animations, dramatic presence
   - **For Information Function**: Clear tech aesthetic, circuit patterns, digital effects

3. **Test**: Show design to target players
   - "Would you pursue this?" (Goal function test)
   - "Do you think it looks cool?" (Spectacle function test)
   - "Which dynasty is this from?" (Information function test)
