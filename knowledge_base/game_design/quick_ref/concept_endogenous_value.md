# Endogenous Value - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (2008), Chapter 3

## Core Concept

"Endogenous value" (coined by Greg Costikyan) means value created internally by the game itself, meaningful only within the game's magic circle. Monopoly money matters intensely during play, becomes worthless afterward. Strong endogenous value indicates compelling games—players care deeply about in-game achievements because the game earned that importance.

## Key Points

- **Game-Generated Meaning:** Games create their own value systems independent of real-world worth
- **Compulsion Indicator:** High endogenous value = compelling game; low = players need external incentives (real money gambling)
- **The Bubsy vs. Sonic Test:** Bubsy's yarn balls had zero endogenous value (no gameplay benefit), so players ignored them. Sonic's rings mattered (protection + extra lives), so players obsessively collected them.
- **Real-World Crossover:** When game items trade for real money (MMO gear sales), endogenous value has exceeded game boundaries—ultimate compulsion proof

## Application to SupaSnake

**High Endogenous Value Systems:**
- **DNA Currency:** Scarce resource needed for breeding attempts—players carefully spend, track accumulation
- **Rare Variants:** "Obsidian Variant" means nothing outside SupaSnake, but completing the set drives intense play
- **Dynasty Completion:** Panini psychology creates powerful internal goals—"one more to finish this dynasty"
- **Generation Numbers:** "Gen 5 snake" has prestige value within player community, zero outside

**Low Endogenous Value Warning:** If DNA or variants feel meaningless, game fails. Energy must feel valuable (enables breeding), not punishing (blocks play).

## Modern Context

**2008 Context:** MMO gear selling for real money was novel phenomenon
**2025 Mobile F2P:** In-app purchases deliberately blur endogenous/exogenous value. Paying real money for gems makes gems feel "really valuable," but can destroy endogenous magic. SupaSnake's DNA remains pure endogenous—earned through play, never purchased, preserving intrinsic motivation.
