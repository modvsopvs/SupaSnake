# Lens #25: The Lens of Judgment

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (3rd Edition, 2020), Chapter 11

## The Lens

To decide if your game is a good judge of the players, ask yourself these questions:

- **What does your game judge about the players?**
- **How does it communicate this judgment?**
- **Do players feel the judgment is fair?**
- **Do they care about the judgment?**
- **Does the judgment make them want to improve?**

## Core Insight

Humans deeply need to be judged—we want to know how we stack up. We don't hate judgment; we hate *unfair* judgment. Games are excellent systems for objective judgment, which makes them inherently appealing. Good judgment systems drive self-improvement motivation (Maslow's Level 4: Self-Esteem).

## Application to SupaSnake

**What SupaSnake Judges:**

**Snake Skill (Primary):**
- Survival time (seconds alive)
- DNA collected per run (efficiency)
- Perfect runs (zero-hit completion)
- Combo chains (consecutive pickups)

**Collection Progress (Secondary):**
- Variants unlocked (breadth)
- Dynasties completed (depth)
- Set bonuses earned (optimization)

**Breeding Strategy (Tertiary):**
- Rare variant discoveries
- Generation depth (breeding tree mastery)
- Optimal combination efficiency

**Communication Methods:**

**Immediate Feedback:**
- Run summary screen (DNA earned, survival time, combos)
- Visual DNA counter during play (live judgment)
- Perfect run celebration (special animation + 2× DNA)

**Persistent Judgment:**
- Collection Lab progress bars (7/10 CYBER variants)
- Personal bests dashboard (high scores, longest survival)
- Clan leaderboards (social comparison)
- Achievement badges (Novice → Expert → Master)

**Fairness:**
- ✅ Skill controls DNA (skill = reward)
- ✅ Equal energy cost (fair access)
- ✅ No pay-to-win (money = convenience, not power)
- ⚠️ Energy limits (mitigated: generous F2P, paid refills optional)

**Player Care:** Tyler cares about skill judgment (mastery), Emma cares about collection judgment (achievement)—both find meaningful judgment.

**Drives Improvement:** Run summaries show "Best: 187 DNA" → "Can I beat 200?", collection shows "7/10" → "Close to set bonus!", leaderboards motivate rank climbing.

**Philosophy:** Judge *performance* (skill, strategy) not *payment* (wallet). Preserves intrinsic motivation and fairness.
