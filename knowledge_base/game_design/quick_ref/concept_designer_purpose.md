# Designer Purpose - Quick Reference

**Source:** Schell, Chapter 35 "Your Purpose"

## Core Question

**Why do you make games?**

Not "to make money" (that's a requirement, not a purpose). What deeper reason drives you to create?

## Finding Your Purpose

**Purpose gives meaning to work** - it's the "why" that sustains you through hard times, guides difficult decisions, and defines your legacy.

**Common Designer Purposes:**
- Bring joy to people's lives
- Teach important lessons
- Build communities
- Create beauty
- Challenge conventions
- Tell meaningful stories
- Solve interesting problems
- Leave the world better than you found it

## SupaSnake's Designer Purpose

**Primary Purpose: Build sustainable indie career creating ethical mobile games**

**Supporting Purposes:**
1. **Prove ethical F2P works financially**
   - Show you don't need dark patterns to succeed
   - Demonstrate respectful monetization can be profitable
   - Inspire other indie devs to build ethically

2. **Develop professional skills**
   - Master React Native and mobile development
   - Learn F2P game design deeply
   - Build portfolio piece for future opportunities
   - Practice full-stack game development solo

3. **Create positive player experiences**
   - Transform casual players into strategic thinkers
   - Build welcoming community around shared interest
   - Provide stress relief and joy
   - Respect players' time and money

4. **Eventually mentor other indie developers**
   - Share learnings openly (docs, blog posts)
   - Help others avoid mobile F2P pitfalls
   - Build reputation as ethical designer
   - Give back to indie community

## Purpose vs. Goals

**Goals** (specific, measurable):
- Launch SupaSnake on iOS
- Reach 10,000 downloads in first month
- Achieve 4.5+ star rating
- Generate $2,000/month by month 6

**Purpose** (enduring, directional):
- Build sustainable indie career
- Make ethical mobile games
- Help players grow
- Raise industry standards

**Purpose guides decisions. Goals measure progress.**

## How Purpose Guides Design

**When facing design dilemma, ask:**
- Does this serve my purpose?
- Will I be proud of this decision?
- Does this move me toward my mission?
- Is this who I want to be as a designer?

**Example:**
- **Dilemma:** Add daily login bonuses (common F2P pattern)?
- **Purpose Check:** Does this respect players' time? (No - creates FOMO)
- **Decision:** Skip daily bonuses, use energy regeneration instead
- **Result:** Aligned with purpose (ethical F2P)

## Staying True to Purpose

**Common Pressures to Compromise:**
- Low revenue → "Maybe add loot boxes?"
- Competitor success → "They use FOMO timers..."
- Publisher pressure → "Users expect this..."
- Peer advice → "You're leaving money on the table"

**Resistance Through Purpose:**
- **Low revenue:** "My purpose is sustainable career, not quick cash"
- **Competitor:** "My purpose is proving ethical works, not copying"
- **Pressure:** "My purpose is my integrity, not someone else's metrics"
- **Peers:** "My purpose values player respect over maximum extraction"

## Purpose Evolution

**Your purpose may evolve over time:**
- Start: "Learn mobile F2P"
- Mid: "Build ethical mobile games"
- Later: "Help other indies succeed"
- Eventually: "Raise industry standards"

**That's healthy growth. Core values should remain constant.**

## Questions to Find Your Purpose

1. What gets you excited to work on your game?
2. What would make you abandon the project?
3. What impact do you want to have on players?
4. What legacy do you want to leave?
5. What would you do even if it wasn't profitable?
6. What makes you proud to be a game designer?
7. What change do you want to see in the industry?

**Write your answers. Your purpose will emerge.**
