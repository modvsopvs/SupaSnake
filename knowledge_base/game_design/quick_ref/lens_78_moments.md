# Lens #78: The Lens of Moments - Quick Reference

## The Lens

**Ask yourself:**
- What are the memorable moments in my game?
- How can I create more moments like these?
- Are these moments happening by accident or design?
- Can I create a string of moments that form a meaningful experience?

## Core Insight

Games are remembered through specific moments, not aggregate experiences. Players recall the time they pulled off an amazing combo, discovered a rare snake, or completed their first dynastyâ€”not the average quality of their sessions. Design deliberately for peak moments.

## Moment Types

**Achievement Moments**
- First rare variant discovered
- Dynasty completed
- Perfect Classic Mode run
- 100% collection milestone

**Discovery Moments**
- Unlocking Evolution Lab
- Finding secret variant pattern
- Unexpected breeding result
- Hidden achievement revealed

**Emotional Moments**
- Attachment to specific snake
- Pride in unique breeding creation
- Frustration overcome (difficult achievement)
- Joy of completing collection

**Social Moments** (Future)
- Sharing rare snake
- Competing on leaderboard
- Trading with friends
- Showing off collection

## Design Techniques

**Build-Up**
Create anticipation before the moment:
- Breeding: Egg shaking animation before reveal
- Evolution: Transformation sequence with effects
- Collection: Completion meter approaching 100%
- Classic: Score climbing toward milestone

**Peak Experience**
Make the moment itself special:
- Unique animation (not reused elsewhere)
- Special sound effect
- Screen effects (particles, flash, shake)
- Time slowdown or pause
- Haptic feedback pulse

**Savoring**
Let player enjoy the moment:
- Don't auto-dismiss success screens
- Allow screenshot capture
- Replay option for special animations
- Share functionality
- Permanent record in collection

**Memory Anchoring**
Help player remember the moment:
- Achievement system (permanent record)
- Screenshots in collection
- Stats/history tracking
- Named accomplishments
- Timestamp of special moments

## Anti-Patterns

**Moment Dilution**
- Using special effects too frequently (nothing feels special)
- Same animation for common and rare results
- No build-up or payoff (instant reveal without ceremony)
- Auto-skipping important moments

**Moment Interruption**
- Forced ads during peak experience
- Crashes after achievement (losing progress)
- Battery dying at crucial moment
- Notifications disrupting flow

**Moment Fatigue**
- Too many peak moments too close together
- Overwhelming celebration animations
- Constant unlock notifications
- Achievement spam

## SupaSnake Applications

**Daily Moment Design**
Each play session should include:
- 1-2 micro-moments (small wins)
- Chance for medium moment (rare breeding, new variant)
- Possible peak moment (major milestone)

**Progression of Moments**
Early game: Frequent small moments (builds engagement)
Mid game: Mix of small and medium moments
Late game: Rare but powerful peak moments (major achievements)

**Moment Spacing**
- Classic Mode: Moments every 30-60 seconds (score milestones)
- Breeding Lab: Moment every 2-3 breeds (occasional rare)
- Evolution Lab: Moment per evolution (always special)
- Collection: Moments at completion thresholds (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)

## Testing for Moments

**Questions to Ask**
- Would players screenshot this?
- Will they tell friends about it?
- Will they remember it tomorrow? Next week? Next month?
- Does it feel special or routine?
- Does the presentation match the moment's importance?

**Iteration Focus**
- Identify existing moments in playtesting
- Enhance the good ones (bigger, better presentation)
- Create new moments where experience feels flat
- Remove false moments (over-celebrated trivial events)
