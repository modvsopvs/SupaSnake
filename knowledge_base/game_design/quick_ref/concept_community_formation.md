# Community Formation - Quick Reference

**Context**: Mobile collection game communities form differently than MMOs - asynchronous, platform-distributed, shared passion for collecting/breeding.

## Core Principles

**Why Communities Form**:
- Shared interest (snake collecting, rare variants, breeding strategies)
- Social connection (showing off collections, trading tips)
- Competition (leaderboards, rarest collections)
- Mutual support (breeding guides, DNA farming strategies)

**Formation Stages**:
1. **Discovery** - Players find the game organically or through ads
2. **Lurking** - Silent players observe communities before participating
3. **Contributing** - Share first breeding success or rare pull
4. **Leading** - Create guides, moderate discussions, organize events

## Mobile Game Community Platforms

| Platform | Purpose | Engagement Level |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| **In-Game** | Daily play, async interaction | High frequency, low depth |
| **Discord** | Real-time chat, breeding tips, announcements | Medium frequency, high depth |
| **Reddit** | Guides, showcase posts, patch discussions | Low frequency, very high depth |
| **Social Media** | Viral moments, art shares, memes | Sporadic, broad reach |

## Solo Dev Implications

**Start Small**:
- Launch with minimal community infrastructure (Twitter + subreddit)
- Grow Discord only when 500+ active players
- Avoid premature moderation overhead

**Seed Community**:
- Recruit 5-10 beta testers as "founding players"
- Give exclusive founder variants as status symbols
- Empower early adopters to create guides

**Async-First Design**:
- Players don't need to be online simultaneously
- Community features: shared breeding tips, collection showcases, time-shifted events
- No real-time co-op required for v1.0

## Key Metrics

- **Active Discord Members** - Weekly message count, not total members
- **Guide Creation** - Player-made breeding calculators, strategy posts
- **Viral Moments** - Screenshots of rare pulls shared on social media
- **Retention Cohorts** - Do community members stay longer?
