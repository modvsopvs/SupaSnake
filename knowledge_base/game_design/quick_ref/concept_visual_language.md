# Visual Language - Quick Reference

## Overview

Visual language is the consistent system of shapes, colors, and symbols that communicates meaning without words. SupaSnake uses distinct visual languages for each dynasty to create instant recognition and emotional response.

## What Visual Language Does

**Communicates Without Words**
- Rarity visible through visual treatment (glow, particles, aura)
- Dynasty identity through color palette
- Generation through subtle aging/refinement effects
- Status (new, evolved, maxed) through visual badges

**Creates Emotional Response**
- CYBER: Sharp angles = precision, danger, tech
- PRIMAL: Organic curves = power, ancient, natural
- COSMIC: Flowing forms = mystery, ethereal, vast

## SupaSnake Visual Vocabulary

**Shape Language by Dynasty**

| Dynasty | Primary Shapes | Secondary Shapes | UI Elements |
|---------|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| **CYBER** | Hard triangles, hexagons | Circuit patterns, straight lines | Angular frames, digital displays |
| **PRIMAL** | Organic blobs, scales | Stone textures, claw marks | Rough-hewn frames, natural materials |
| **COSMIC** | Spirals, nebulae | Star clusters, flowing ribbons | Ethereal glows, particle trails |

**Color Communication**

- **Common**: Gray/white (60% saturation)
- **Uncommon**: Single accent color (75% saturation)
- **Rare**: Dual colors (90% saturation)
- **Epic**: Tri-color with glow (100% + bloom)
- **Legendary**: Full spectrum with animated effects

**Motion Language**

- **CYBER**: Stutter-step animations, digital glitches, precise movements
- **PRIMAL**: Fluid organic motion, breathing effects, natural flow
- **COSMIC**: Floating drift, particle trails, slow rotation

## Visual Consistency Rules

1. **Dynasty purity**: Never mix CYBER angles with PRIMAL curves
2. **Rarity clarity**: Higher rarity = more visual effects (controlled escalation)
3. **Readability**: All effects must enhance, not obscure, the snake
4. **Mobile-first**: Test at 5" screen size minimum

## Visual Feedback Systems

**Player Actions**
- Tap: Ripple effect in dynasty colors
- Swipe: Trail in dynasty style
- Hold: Pulse/glow buildup
- Success: Dynasty-appropriate celebration (CYBER=digital burst, PRIMAL=roar effect, COSMIC=star explosion)

**Game Events**
- New snake: Reveal animation with dynasty flair
- Evolution: Transformation effect matching visual language
- Rare pull: Screen-wide dynasty-themed celebration
