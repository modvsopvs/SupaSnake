# Lens #22: The Lens of Needs

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (3rd Edition, 2020), Chapter 11

## The Lens

To use this lens, stop thinking about your game, and start thinking about what basic human needs it fulfills.

Ask yourself these questions:

- **On which levels of Maslow's hierarchy is my game operating?**
- **Does it fill the needs of competence, autonomy, and relatedness?**
- **How can I make my game fill more basic needs than it already does?**
- **For the needs my game is already filling, how can it fill those needs even better?**

## Core Insight

Games must deliver actual need fulfillment, not just promise it. If players imagine your game will make them feel competent or connected but it doesn't deliver, they'll find a game that does. Needs aren't wants—they're psychological requirements.

## Application to SupaSnake

**Current Need Coverage:**

**Maslow's Hierarchy:**
- Level 3 (Love/Belonging): Clans, shared breeding discoveries
- Level 4 (Self-Esteem): Snake mastery, collection completion
- Level 5 (Self-Actualization): Creative breeding strategies

**Self-Determination Theory:**
- Competence: ✅ Strong (Snake skill curve, breeding mastery)
- Autonomy: ✅ Strong (voluntary play, choice freedom)
- Relatedness: ⚠️ Moderate (clans are light, mostly solo)

**Improvement Questions:**

**Fill More Needs:**
- Add Level 2 (Safety)? Fantasy context—protect snake species from extinction via breeding?
- Strengthen Level 3? Enhanced clan features (shared breeding projects, clan-exclusive variants)?

**Fill Existing Needs Better:**
- **Competence**: Add skill badges (Perfect Run achievements), visible rank progression (Novice → Expert → Master)
- **Autonomy**: More dynasty variety (6 in v0.5), customizable snake skins (express personal style)
- **Relatedness**: Breeding discovery sharing, community leaderboards by play style (not just scores)

**Emma vs Tyler Needs:**
- Emma needs stronger relatedness → Prioritize clan features
- Tyler needs stronger competence expression → Add mastery showcases (perfect run hall of fame)
