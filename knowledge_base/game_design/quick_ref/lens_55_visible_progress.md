# Lens #55: The Lens of Visible Progress - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (3rd Edition, 2020), Chapter 14

## Questions to Ask

Players need to see that they are making progress when solving a difficult problem:

1. **What does it mean to make progress** in my game or puzzle?
2. **Is there enough progress?** Is there a way I can add more interim steps of progressive success?
3. **What progress is visible, and what progress is hidden?** Can I find a way to reveal what is hidden?

## Core Insight

Visible progress is the primary driver of mood in workplaces AND games. Rubik's Cube success: completing one side shows clear progress (even though puzzle isn't close to solved). Twenty Questions works because each answer narrows the space. Riddles frustrate because you can't see progress toward answer.

## Application to SupaSnake

**Progress in Classic Mode (Q1):**
- DNA counter increments visibly (+10, +25, +100)
- Score increases in real-time
- Survival time shown (lived 45 seconds this round)
- High score comparison (82% to new record!)

**Interim Steps (Q2):**
- Round-by-round progress (5/7 rounds complete)

- Variant unlock progress bar (7/8 Commons unlocked in this dynasty)
- Collection percentage (42% complete overall)

**Reveal Hidden Progress (Q3):**
- **Hidden:** Total DNA earned across all sessions
- **Reveal:** Lifetime stats screen (45,000 DNA collected!)
- **Hidden:** Variants seen but not unlocked
- **Reveal:** "Seen but not owned" counter (teases what's possible)
- **Hidden:** Breeding possibilities
