# Aesthetic Coherence - Quick Reference

## Overview

Aesthetic coherence means all visual, audio, and interactive elements feel like they belong to the same unified experience. SupaSnake achieves coherence through consistent dynasty theming while maintaining clear mobile-first design principles.

## What Makes Aesthetics Coherent

**Unity of Theme**
- Every element reinforces dynasty identity (CYBER/PRIMAL/COSMIC)
- Visual + audio + haptic all speak same language
- Consistent rules applied everywhere
- No jarring disconnects between systems

**Purposeful Variation**
- Dynasties differ but follow same structural rules
- Rarity tiers consistent across all dynasties
- UI follows mobile conventions, content expresses creativity

## Coherence Layers in SupaSnake

### Layer 1: Dynasty Identity (Variable)

**CYBER Dynasty**
- Visuals: Angular, neon, metallic, circuit patterns
- Audio: Synthetic, digital beeps, modulated tones
- Haptics: Sharp, precise pulses
- Mood: High-tech, precise, futuristic

**PRIMAL Dynasty**
- Visuals: Organic curves, earth tones, natural textures
- Audio: Drums, animal calls, natural resonance
- Haptics: Rumbling, organic vibrations
- Mood: Ancient, powerful, raw nature

**COSMIC Dynasty**
- Visuals: Flowing forms, nebula colors, particle effects
- Audio: Ethereal choir, bells, reverb-heavy
- Haptics: Gentle waves, pulse patterns
- Mood: Mysterious, vast, otherworldly

### Layer 2: Rarity System (Consistent)

Applied identically across all dynasties:
- Common: 60% saturation, simple animation
- Uncommon: 75% saturation, accent glow
- Rare: 90% saturation, dual effects
- Epic: 100% saturation + bloom, tri-color
- Legendary: Animated spectrum, particle trails

### Layer 3: Mobile UX (Universal)

Consistent across entire game:
- 44pt minimum touch targets
- High contrast text (4.5:1 minimum)
- Standard iOS/Android patterns
- Familiar navigation gestures
- Battery-conscious effects

## Coherence Rules

**The 3-Second Test**
Any screenshot should immediately communicate:
1. Which dynasty (color palette + shapes)
2. Approximate rarity (visual intensity)
3. What action is available (clear UI)

**The Mute Test**
Game should be fully playable with sound off:
- Visual feedback for all actions
- Haptic alternatives to audio cues
- No sound-required gameplay

**The Glance Test**
At arm's length (mobile viewing distance):
- Dynasty identity clear
- Rarity distinguishable
- UI elements recognizable
- Text readable

## Common Coherence Breaks

**What to Avoid**
- ❌ CYBER snake with PRIMAL sound effects
- ❌ Rarity inconsistencies (Common brighter than Rare)
- ❌ UI that changes style between screens
- ❌ Touch targets smaller than 44pt
- ❌ Mixing rounded and sharp UI in same dynasty
- ❌ Audio that doesn't match visual intensity

**What to Maintain**
- ✅ Dynasty purity within each lineage
- ✅ Consistent rarity visual language
- ✅ Mobile-first constraints everywhere
- ✅ Unified menu/navigation style
- ✅ Matching audio/visual/haptic intensity

## Aesthetic Consistency Checklist

When adding new content, verify:
- [ ] Dynasty visual language followed?
- [ ] Rarity tier clearly communicated?
- [ ] Audio matches visual intensity?
- [ ] Haptic feedback appropriate?
- [ ] Readable at 5-7" mobile screens?
- [ ] Works in silent mode?
- [ ] Touch targets ≥44pt?
- [ ] Respects battery constraints?

## Coherence Through Contrast

**Intentional Contrasts** (enhance experience)
- Dynasty differences (CYBER vs PRIMAL vs COSMIC)
- Rarity progression (Common → Legendary)
- States (inactive vs active, locked vs unlocked)

**Unintentional Breaks** (hurt experience)
- Inconsistent UI patterns
- Mismatched audio/visual intensity
- Dynasty style mixing
- Mobile-desktop design conflicts
