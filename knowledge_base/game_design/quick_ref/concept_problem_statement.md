# Problem Statement - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (2008), Chapter 6
**SupaSnake Relevance:** CRITICAL

## Core Concept

A problem statement clearly defines WHY you're designing, stating both your goal and your constraints. Good problem statements open creative space by focusing on the problem, not proposed solutions. Start design at the problem level, not the solution level, to find better, more innovative answers.

## Key Structure

**Format:** "How can I [action] that [goal] within [constraints]?"

**Example Evolution:**
- Too narrow: "How can I make a web-based Snake game?"
- Better: "How can I make a mobile game that combines collection and skill?"
- Even better: "How can I make a mobile experience that provides lasting value from skill mastery?"

## Three Key Benefits

1. **Broader Creative Space:** Starting at problem (not solution) opens hidden solution territories
2. **Clear Measurement:** Quality = "How well does this solve the problem?"
3. **Better Communication:** Teams align when problem is clearly stated

## Application to SupaSnake

**Initial Problem Statement (Too Solution-Focused):**
"How can I make a Snake game with collection mechanics?"

**Better Problem Statement (More Open):**
"How can I create a mobile game where player skill has lasting, collectible value?"

**Even Better (Gets at Core Problem):**
"How can I make players feel that their skill mastery creates meaningful, permanent achievements in a mobile game?"

**Constraints Identified:**
- Mobile platform (iOS/Android)
- F2P monetization model
- Solo developer bandwidth
- Must balance skill and collection
- Target: 5-10 min sessions

**Goals Identified:**
- Skill feels meaningful
- Collection provides long-term motivation
- Retention through progression
- Differentiation from pure Snake clones

## Using Tetrad to Check Problem

**Technology:** Mobile touch platform decided? Yes (constraint)
**Mechanics:** Snake-based gameplay decided? Mostly (constraint with flexibility)
**Story:** Dynasty/breeding concept decided? Somewhat (flexible)
**Aesthetics:** Visual style decided? No (open creative space)
