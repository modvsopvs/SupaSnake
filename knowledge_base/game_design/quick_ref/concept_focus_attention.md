# Focus and Attention - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (3rd Edition, 2020), Chapter 10

## Core Concept

The brain selectively focuses attention to make sense of the world, tuning in certain inputs while ignoring others. Games must capture and hold this focus to create engaging experiences. Sustained focus with pleasure and enjoyment creates "flow"—the mental state where time disappears and gameplay feels effortless.

## Key Points

- **Selective Attention:** Brain filters reality, focusing on some inputs while ignoring others (cocktail party effect)
- **Flow State:** Complete focus + enjoyment + loss of time sense = optimal game experience
- **Flow Requirements:** Clear goals, no distractions, direct feedback, continuous appropriate challenge
- **Flow Channel:** Narrow margin between boredom (too easy) and frustration (too hard)

## Flow Components for Games

1. **Clear Goals:** Player always knows what to do next
2. **No Distractions:** Engages both mind and hands fully
3. **Direct Feedback:** Immediate response to actions
4. **Continuous Challenge:** Difficulty adjusts as skill improves

## Application to SupaSnake

**Emma's Flow Path (Casual - 5-10 min sessions):**
- **Clear Goal:** "Collect DNA, unlock new variants"
- **No Distractions:** Quick rounds prevent mind wandering
- **Direct Feedback:** Instant DNA collection, variant unlock celebrations
- **Challenge Balance:** Easy Snake mastery, simple collection completion
- **Flow Entry:** 30 seconds (familiar Snake gameplay)
- **Flow Duration:** 5-10 minutes until energy depletes (natural exit)

**Tyler's Flow Path (Hardcore - 30-60 min sessions):**
- **Clear Goal:** "Get perfect run for rare variant" or "Complete Cyber dynasty"
- **No Distractions:** Breeding strategy occupies both planning and execution
- **Direct Feedback:** High score tracking, breeding result reveals
- **Challenge Balance:** Gradually increasing difficulty (common → rare → legendary variants)
- **Flow Entry:** 2-3 minutes (after session goal is set)
- **Flow Duration:** 30-60 minutes across multiple Snake rounds + breeding

**Tense-Release Cycle:** SupaSnake uses oscillating difficulty:
1. Challenge increases (harder Snake runs, rarer variants needed)
2. Reward provides relief (new variant unlocked, set bonus activated)
3. Brief easy period (empowered by set bonus)
4. Challenge ramps up again (next collection tier)

## Modern Mobile Context (2020)

**3rd Edition (2020):** Csikszentmihalyi's flow research applies to all media, including mobile games.

**SupaSnake Specific:** Mobile sessions are interrupted frequently (doorbell, text message, boss). Design must support:
- **Quick Flow Entry:** 30-60 seconds to first rewarding action (Emma needs instant engagement)
- **Pause Resilience:** Can pause mid-round without breaking flow state
- **Clear Re-Entry:** After interruption, player knows exactly where they were and what's next
