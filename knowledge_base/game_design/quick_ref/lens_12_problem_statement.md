# Lens #12: The Lens of the Problem Statement - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (2008), Chapter 6
**SupaSnake Relevance:** CRITICAL

## Core Concept

View your game as the solution to a problem. This lens forces clarity about what you're really trying to achieve and helps you avoid jumping to solutions too quickly. By thinking of design as problem-solving, you can measure idea quality objectively: "Does this solve the problem?"

## The Four Questions

1. **What problem (or problems) am I really trying to solve?**
2. **Have I been making assumptions that really have nothing to do with its true purpose?**
3. **Is a game really the best solution? Why?**
4. **How will I be able to tell if the problem is solved?**

## Application Method

**Recognize over-constraint:** You might think "web-based game" but the real problem is "teenagers need engaging web experience"—game isn't required!

**Check each tetrad element:** Which are constrained by the problem? Which are open for creative solutions?

**Restate when needed:** As you explore, the real problem often becomes clearer—go back and restate!

## Application to SupaSnake

**Question 1: What problem?**
"Mobile games don't reward skill with lasting value—most are pay-to-win or pure time investment. Players who master skills feel unrewarded."

**Question 2: False assumptions?**
- Assumption: "Must be Snake clone" → Reality: Snake is ONE way to deliver skill mastery
- Assumption: "F2P means pay-to-win" → Reality: Cosmetic/collection monetization possible
- Assumption: "Collection must be like gacha" → Reality: Skill-earned collection different/better

**Question 3: Is game the best solution?**
Yes—games uniquely combine skill mastery with progression systems. Alternative (achievement app) wouldn't provide the moment-to-moment skill satisfaction. Game is solution, not just medium.

**Question 4: How to measure success?**
- **Qualitative:** Player testimonials about feeling their skill matters
- **Quantitative:** Retention curve (skill learning), collection completion rates, variant unlock distribution
- **Key Metric:** Do skilled players progress faster than unskilled regardless of payment?
