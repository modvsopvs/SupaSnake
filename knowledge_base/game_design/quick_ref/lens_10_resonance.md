# Lens #10: The Lens of Resonance - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (2008), Chapter 5
**SupaSnake Relevance:** HIGH

## Core Concept

The Lens of Resonance helps you identify themes that deeply move people because they connect to universal fantasies, desires, or truths. Resonant themes operate at a subconscious level—players may not articulate the theme, but they feel its power. This lens requires listening to yourself and others to find what truly excites.

## The Four Questions

1. **What feels powerful and special about my game?**
2. **What ideas get people really excited when I describe the game?**
3. **If I had no constraints, what would this game be like?**
4. **What is driving my instincts about how this game should be?**

## Two Types of Resonant Themes

**Experience-Based:** Fantasy of being/doing something (e.g., "fantasy of being a pirate" = freedom from obligations)

**Truth-Based:** Deep personal truths (e.g., "Love stronger than death," "Virtue defeats death," "Play must survive against work")

## Application to SupaSnake

**Resonance Test Questions:**

**What feels powerful?** The moment you complete a page in the Collection Lab—satisfying collection completion. The flow state of a perfect Snake run—mastery peak experience.

**What excites people?** "It's like Pokemon meets Snake!" gets strong reactions—combining collection nostalgia with skill nostalgia.

**No constraints version?** Unlimited dynasties, infinite breeding combinations, social trading, competitive mastery rankings.

**What drives instincts?** Desire to recapture childhood collecting + prove skill matters in modern games.

**Potential Resonant Theme:** "Your skill has lasting meaning" (truth-based)—in a world of pay-to-win, SupaSnake says: skill creates permanent value (variants), mastery builds legacy (dynasties), practice matters (generation progression).

## Hidden Power

Resonance is "quiet and delicate"—buried deep, but powerful when found. Test: Does your theme make YOU feel something? If not, it won't move players either.
