# Cooperation & Competition - Quick Reference

## Overview

Cooperation and competition are fundamental social motivators that drive multiplayer engagement. SupaSnake balances both to create healthy social dynamics that enhance rather than replace solo play.

## The Spectrum

**Pure Cooperation** ← → **Healthy Competition** → **Toxic Competition**

SupaSnake lives in the middle: healthy competition with cooperative elements, avoiding toxicity.

- No punishment for non-participation

## Balancing Both
