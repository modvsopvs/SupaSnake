# Player Needs - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (3rd Edition, 2020), Chapter 11

## Core Concept

Players have fundamental human needs that games can fulfill. Two key frameworks: Maslow's Hierarchy (physiological → safety → love/belonging → esteem → self-actualization) and Self-Determination Theory (competence, autonomy, relatedness). Games that fulfill more basic needs create stronger, longer-lasting motivation.

## Key Points

- **Maslow's Hierarchy**: Players pursue higher needs only when lower needs are satisfied (safety before social connection, social connection before self-esteem)
- **Self-Determination Theory (SDT)**: Three mental needs—**competence** (feel skilled), **autonomy** (freedom to choose), **relatedness** (connect with others)
- **Games Excel at Needs**: Games naturally fulfill competence (mastery), autonomy (voluntary play), and relatedness (multiplayer)
- **Need Stacking**: Games covering multiple hierarchy levels have more staying power (Minecraft covers all 5 levels)
- **Real Needs**: These aren't wants or preferences—unmet mental needs cause unhealthy psychological states

## Application to SupaSnake

**Maslow's Hierarchy:**
- **Level 4 (Esteem)**: Snake mastery, collection completion
- **Level 3 (Belonging)**: Clans, leaderboards, breeding sharing
- **Level 5 (Self-Actualization)**: Breeding strategy creativity

**Self-Determination Theory:**
- **Competence**: Snake skill progression, visible improvement
- **Autonomy**: Dynasty focus choice, breeding paths, DNA spending decisions
- **Relatedness**: Clan bonuses, social features

**Persona Differences:** Emma focuses on levels 3-4 (social/esteem), Tyler on levels 4-5 (esteem/actualization).

## Modern Mobile Context (2020)

**3rd Edition (2020):** Schell emphasizes multiplayer games' power—they fulfill more basic needs (love/belonging at level 3) than single-player (self-esteem at level 4), explaining their retention advantage.

**SupaSnake Specific:** Solo-primary game must compensate for missing level 3. Solution: Clan bonuses create light social connection without requiring synchronous play. Collection system targets level 4 (competence at completing sets), breeding targets level 5 (creative self-expression).
