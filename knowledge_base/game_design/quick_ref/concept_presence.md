# Presence - Quick Reference

## Core Concept

Presence is the feeling of "being there"â€”the player's sense of inhabiting the game world rather than just observing it. In mobile games, presence doesn't require VR or 3D environments; it emerges from responsive feedback, polished interactions, and the player's mental investment in the game's reality.

## Types of Presence (Schell's Framework)

**Physical Presence**
The sense of being in a place. In SupaSnake:
- Not literal (2D mobile interface)
- Created through consistent spatial logic (Labs feel like real places)
- Visual coherence (lighting, materials, scale)
- Spatial audio (if implemented)

**Social Presence**
The sense of being with others. In SupaSnake:
- Your collection is uniquely yours (ownership)
- Snakes feel like companions (not just data)
- Future: Leaderboards, sharing, trading (community)

**Self Presence**
The sense that "this is me" in the game. In SupaSnake:
- Your dynasty choices reflect your strategy
- Your collection represents your journey
- Your breeding experiments are personal creations
- Progression systems create growing identity

## Creating Presence in 2D Mobile

**Responsiveness is Key**
- Instant visual feedback to touch
- Smooth animations (60fps target)
- No lag between input and response
- Haptic feedback on important actions
- Audio confirmation of actions

**Visual Polish Creates Belief**
- Consistent art style maintains reality
- Attention to detail (shadows, highlights, micro-animations)
- No obvious technical artifacts (clipping, pop-in)
- Smooth transitions between states
- Visual feedback for every interaction

**Mental Immersion**
- Clear game logic (world makes sense)
- Consistent rules (no arbitrary changes)
- Meaningful choices (player agency matters)
- Progression that feels earned
- Narrative coherence (Labs exist in a world)

## Threats to Presence

**Technical Disruptions**
- Lag, stutter, frame drops
- Loading screens breaking flow
- Crashes or bugs
- Inconsistent performance
- Visual glitches

**Design Inconsistencies**
- UI that breaks spatial metaphor
- Arbitrary rules or changes
- Confusing navigation
- Unclear affordances
- Inconsistent feedback

**External Interruptions**
- Forced ads (if implemented)
- Notifications from other apps
- Phone calls, messages
- Battery/connectivity warnings
- Context switches

## SupaSnake Presence Strategy

**Maintain the Lab Reality**
- Each Lab feels like a coherent place
- Transitions are smooth, not jarring
- No sudden style shifts
- Consistent interaction patterns
- Visual and audio harmony

**Player Investment**
- Collection grows with effort
- Breeding creates unique results (player authorship)
- Evolution represents achievement
- Dynasties reflect strategic choices
- Progress is visible and meaningful

**Polish Over Features**
- Better to have 3 Labs working beautifully
- Than 6 Labs with rough edges
- Responsiveness trumps visual complexity
- Smooth 60fps beats fancy effects that stutter
- Consistent quality maintains immersion

## Measuring Presence

Indicators of strong presence:
- Players refer to "my snakes" not "the snakes"
- Time flies when playing (flow state)
- Players develop emotional attachment
- Session length increases naturally
- Players remember specific moments
- Mental imagery persists after playing

Indicators of weak presence:
- Frequent breaks in play
- Awareness of device/time
- Frustration with controls
- Confusion about location/context
- Emotional detachment from content

## Mobile-Specific Considerations

**Short Session Design**
- Presence can exist in 30-second bursts
- Quick re-immersion after interruption
- Save state perfectly (no lost progress)
- Resume exactly where left off

**One-Handed Play**
- Controls accessible in thumb zone
- No need to shift grip
- Comfortable, sustained interaction
- Minimal hand fatigue

**Environmental Flexibility**
- Readable in bright light
- Clear audio not required (visual feedback sufficient)
- Interruptible without penalty
- No forced timing pressure
