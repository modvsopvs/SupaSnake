# Lens #80: The Lens of Empathy - Quick Reference

## The Lens

**Ask yourself:**
- What does it really feel like to play my game?
- What is the player thinking at each moment?
- What emotions are they experiencing?
- Where do they feel confused, frustrated, or delighted?
- Am I designing for the player I imagine, or the player who actually exists?

## Core Insight

True empathy means experiencing your game as players doâ€”not as the designer who knows all the answers. You must temporarily forget what you know and see through fresh eyes. This is difficult but essential for creating experiences that truly resonate.

## The Empathy Challenge

**Designer Blindness**
- You know the systems intimately
- You understand the intended flow
- You see potential, not reality
- You forgive rough edges
- You mentally fill in missing pieces

**Player Reality**
- Everything is new and unclear
- They don't know your intentions
- They judge what exists, not potential
- Rough edges break immersion
- Missing pieces feel like failures

## Techniques for Empathy

**Fresh Eyes Playtesting**
- Watch people who've never seen your game
- Don't explain anything (observe what's clear vs confusing)
- Note where they hesitate, get stuck, or misunderstand
- Listen to questions they ask
- Watch what they expect vs what happens

**Role-Playing Different Players**

**The Casual Player**
- Limited time, playing on commute
- Doesn't read tutorials
- Wants immediate fun
- Easily distracted
- Judges quickly (keep or delete)

**The Collector**
- Wants to catch 'em all
- Loves completion meters
- Studies variants carefully
- Plans optimal strategies
- Plays for completeness

**The Strategist**
- Wants to optimize
- Studies breeding genetics
- Plans long-term progression
- Experiments systematically
- Plays for mastery

**The Casual Breeder**
- Plays occasionally
- Likes surprises
- Doesn't min-max
- Enjoys discovery
- Plays for variety

## SupaSnake Empathy Applications

**First-Time Player Experience**

**What They See (Collection Lab)**
- Grid of snake cards (clear purpose: collection)
- Some colored dots (unclear: what are these?)
- Locked spaces (frustration: why can't I access?)
- Numbers on cards (confusion: what do stats mean?)

**Empathetic Design Response**
- Brief visual tutorial (dots = variants)
- "Unlock at level 5" messaging
- Stat tooltips on tap
- Clear iconography with text labels

**Breeding Lab First Visit**

**What They Feel**
- Excitement (new capability unlocked)
- Confusion (how does this work?)
- Anxiety (will I waste my DNA?)
- Curiosity (what happens if I try this?)

**Empathetic Design Response**
- Optional tutorial (can skip if confident)
- Preview before committing DNA
- Clear cost display
- Low-cost starter breeding option
- Confirmation before spending

**Evolution Lab Discovery**

**What They Experience**
- Achievement (unlocked something advanced)
- Intimidation (looks complex)
- Curiosity (what can I do here?)
- Caution (seems expensive/risky)

**Empathetic Design Response**
- Celebratory unlock moment
- Clear explanation of benefits
- Show requirements before entry
- Preview transformations
- No irreversible choices

## Common Empathy Failures

**Assuming Knowledge**
- Not explaining dynasty system
- Unclear breeding mechanics
- Hidden stat meanings
- Unexplained icons

**Ignoring Emotions**
- No celebration for achievements
- Harsh punishment for experimentation
- Frustrating randomness without consolation
- Lack of progress feedback

**Disrespecting Time**
- Tedious repeated actions
- Unskippable animations (after first view)
- Unclear how to proceed
- Hidden optimal paths (forcing trial-error)

**Forgetting Context**
- Designing for uninterrupted play (mobile reality: constant interruption)
- Assuming full attention (players multitask)
- Expecting memory of complex rules between sessions
- Not explaining after time away

## Empathy-Driven Features

- Help button always accessible
- Contextual hints (only when stuck)
- Clear visual affordances (what's clickable)

**For Busy Players**
- Instant save/resume
- No forced sessions or timers
- Quick interactions (efficient UI)
- Progress visible at a glance

**For Anxious Players**

**For Achievement-Oriented Players**
- Progress meters everywhere
- Clear goals and milestones
- Celebration of accomplishments
- Stats and history tracking

## Practicing Empathy

**Watch Silently**
Most powerful technique: Watch someone play without helping.

**Note:**
- Where do they pause? (confusion)
- What do they tap repeatedly? (expectation mismatch)
- When do they smile? (delight moment)
- When do they sigh? (frustration)
- What do they mutter? (mental model revealed)

**Ask After (Not During)**
- "What were you trying to do when...?"
- "What did you expect to happen when...?"
- "How did you feel when...?"
- "What would you change?"

**Regular Empathy Practice**
- Delete your save data and replay as new player
- Play on different device (different context)
- Play in different locations (bus, couch, standing)
- Play when tired, distracted (real-world conditions)
- Play competitors' games (fresh perspective)
