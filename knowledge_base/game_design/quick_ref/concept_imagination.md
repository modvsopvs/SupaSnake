# Imagination - Quick Reference

**Source:** Jesse Schell, "The Art of Game Design" (3rd Edition, 2020), Chapter 10

## Core Concept

Imagination is the everyday mental ability to automatically fill in gaps, visualize scenarios, and manipulate mental models. Players use imagination for two crucial functions: communication/storytelling (understanding the game world) and problem-solving (planning moves, testing strategies mentally).

## Key Points

- **Automatic Gap-Filling:** When given incomplete information, brains automatically fill in details (story: "mailman stole my car" → brain creates full scene)
- **Mental Manipulation:** Can imagine objects in different states (different color, different size, made of oatmeal, walking around)
- **Problem-Solving Tool:** Plan solutions mentally before acting (change light bulb without ladder → imagine solutions)
- **Design Application:** Games don't need to show every detail—players fill in rest

## Two Functions of Imagination

**1. Communication/Storytelling:**
- Understanding game world from minimal cues
- Filling in narrative gaps
- Creating emotional investment from simple representations

**2. Problem-Solving:**
- Planning moves mentally before executing
- Testing strategies without committing
- Visualizing consequences of actions

## Application to SupaSnake

**Emma's Imagination (Casual - Narrative Focus):**

**Gap-Filling in Collection Lab:**
- Shows: Snake egg icon + "Breeding..." timer
- Emma imagines: "My snakes are creating a new baby snake"
- Design provides: Minimal cues (egg, timer, parent snakes)
- Emma fills in: Emotional narrative ("caring for my snake family")

**Simple Visual Cues Work:**
- DNA icon → "genetic material for breeding"
- Energy lightning bolt → "charges that let me play"
- Panini book slots → "collection to complete"
- No lengthy explanations needed—imagination does the work

**Tyler's Imagination (Hardcore - Problem-Solving Focus):**

**Mental Strategy Planning:**
- Sees: Breeding Lab with parent snakes + generation stats
- Imagines: "If I breed Gen 3 Cyber with Gen 2 Mystic, I might get rare hybrid"
- Tests mentally: Different breeding combinations before committing DNA
- Design enables: Clear stat displays for mental calculation

**Discovery Speculation:**
- Sees: 27 variant slots in Cyber dynasty, has 22
- Imagines: "Must be 5 rare variants I haven't found yet—maybe breeding combinations?"
- Searches: YouTube guides, experiments with breeding
- Design rewards: Hidden combinations discovered through imaginative experimentation

**Minimal UI, Maximum Imagination:**
- Shows: Dynasty icons (Cyber, Mystic, Quantum)
- Players imagine: Full thematic worlds (Tyler: "Cyber dynasty is futuristic tech snakes")
- Shows: Variant silhouettes in locked slots
- Players imagine: What the unlocked variants will look like (anticipation builds)

## Design Philosophy: "Less is More"

**What to Show:**
- Core information needed for decisions (DNA cost, breeding time, variant rarity)
- Visual hooks that trigger imagination (dynasty themes, variant previews)
- Progress indicators that suggest narrative (generation counter, evolution stages)

**What to Leave to Imagination:**
- Detailed lore (players create own stories)
- Exact breeding mechanics (discovery space)
- Variant backstories (players assign meaning)

**Result:** Lower cognitive load (Emma appreciates simplicity) + discovery space (Tyler loves figuring things out).

## Modern Mobile Context (2020)

**3rd Edition (2020):** Schell emphasizes imagination as communication tool—showing less can engage more.

**SupaSnake Specific:** Mobile screens are small, sessions are short. Can't afford text-heavy tutorials or complex explanations. Must leverage player imagination:
- **Visual Learning:** Icon language (DNA, Energy, variants) understood instantly
- **Minimal Text:** "Breeding..." + timer → full narrative imagined
- **Suggestive Design:** Dynasty themes suggest (don't dictate) player interpretation
