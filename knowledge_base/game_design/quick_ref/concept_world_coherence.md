# World Coherence - Quick Reference

**Source**: The Art of Game Design (Schell), Chapter 19

## Core Concept

World coherence means all elements of a game world follow consistent internal logic and reinforce each other. A coherent world feels believable even if unrealistic - players understand and trust the world's rules.

## Key Principle

**Coherence > Realism**
- Internal consistency matters more than real-world accuracy
- Players accept fantasy if rules are clear and followed
- Breaking established patterns breaks immersion

## The Coherence Checklist

**Visual Coherence**
- Does everything look like it belongs together?
- Can players instantly identify dynasty from visuals?
- Are art styles consistent within each world?

**Thematic Coherence**
- Do all elements support the core theme?
- Does gameplay reinforce world identity?
- Are mechanics dynasty-appropriate?

**Tonal Coherence**
- Is emotional tone consistent?
- Does music match visual style?
- Do sound effects fit world physics?

**Logical Coherence**
- Do world rules make sense?
- Are there contradictions in how things work?
- Can players predict outcomes based on world logic?

## SupaSnake Dynasty Coherence

**CYBER Dynasty:**
- **Visual**: Neon colors, geometric patterns, digital artifacts, circuit traces, glitch effects
- **Thematic**: Technology, data, networks, artificial evolution, digital consciousness
- **Tonal**: Sleek, modern, precise, energetic, synthetic
- **Logic**: Variants evolve through code/algorithms, breeding = data merging

**Coherence Rules:**
- All CYBER variants use tech-inspired designs
- Animations have digital effects (particles, scan lines, pixelation)
- UI elements use geometric shapes, sharp edges
- Sounds are synthetic, electronic, processed

**PRIMAL Dynasty:**
- **Visual**: Earthy tones, organic textures, scales, tribal patterns, natural materials
- **Thematic**: Nature, ancestry, primal forces, ancient wisdom, elemental power
- **Tonal**: Raw, powerful, grounded, timeless, authentic
- **Logic**: Variants evolve through natural selection, breeding = instinct-driven

**Coherence Rules:**
- All PRIMAL variants use natural/tribal designs
- Animations use organic motion (fluid, irregular)
- UI elements use rough edges, hand-drawn feel
- Sounds are acoustic, environmental, natural

**COSMIC Dynasty:**
- **Visual**: Deep space colors, nebula effects, ethereal glow, stellar patterns, mystic symbols
- **Thematic**: Space, mystery, transcendence, cosmic forces, infinite possibility
- **Tonal**: Mysterious, vast, serene, otherworldly, profound
- **Logic**: Variants evolve through cosmic forces, breeding = destiny/fate

**Coherence Rules:**
- All COSMIC variants use space/mystic designs
- Animations use flowing, ethereal effects (trails, glows, particles)
- UI elements use curved forms, soft edges, gradients
- Sounds are ambient, resonant, ethereal

## Testing Coherence

**The "Belongs" Test:**
- Show variant without context - can player identify dynasty?
- Play animation - does it feel like its dynasty?
- Show UI element - which dynasty is it from?

**The "Surprise" Test:**
- Would this element surprise players? (If yes, may break coherence)
- Does this fit player's mental model of the dynasty?
- Is this consistent with previous dynasty examples?

**The "Mix" Test:**
- Put CYBER variant in PRIMAL world - does it clash? (It should)
- Play COSMIC music with CYBER visuals - does it feel wrong? (It should)
- Cross-dynasty elements should feel intentional (like hybrid variants)

## Coherence in Breeding System

**Pure Dynasty Breeding:**
- CYBER × CYBER = 100% tech aesthetic
- PRIMAL × PRIMAL = 100% natural aesthetic
- COSMIC × COSMIC = 100% space aesthetic

**Cross-Dynasty Breeding:**
- CYBER × PRIMAL = Tech-organic hybrid (clear mix, not muddy)
- CYBER × COSMIC = Digital-mystical fusion (intentional contrast)
- PRIMAL × COSMIC = Nature-space blend (harmonious merger)

**Coherence Rule:** Hybrids should show clear influence from both parents, not random mix

## Common Coherence Breaks

**Visual Breaks:**
- CYBER variant with hand-drawn textures (use geometric/clean instead)
- PRIMAL variant with neon glow (use natural luminescence)
- COSMIC variant with sharp, rigid patterns (use flowing forms)

**Thematic Breaks:**
- CYBER variant named "Ancient Warrior" (use tech terms)
- PRIMAL variant with circuit patterns (use tribal patterns)
- COSMIC variant that feels grounded/mundane (maintain mystery)

**Tonal Breaks:**
- Comedic element in serious dynasty
- Modern slang in PRIMAL dynasty text
- Harsh/aggressive sounds in serene COSMIC

## Quick Facts

- **First Impression = Dynasty Identity**: Players should instantly recognize world
- **Consistency Builds Trust**: Coherence makes players comfortable exploring
- **Coherence Enables Creativity**: Strong rules allow meaningful rule-breaking (hybrids)
- **Test Early, Test Often**: Show variants to fresh eyes - do they "get" the dynasty?

## Design Questions

- Can I identify dynasty from this element alone?
- Does this element reinforce or contradict dynasty identity?
- Would this surprise a player familiar with the dynasty?
- Is this mixing dynasties intentionally or accidentally?
