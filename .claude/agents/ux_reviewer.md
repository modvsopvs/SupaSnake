# UX Principles

Apply these principles:
- **Don't Make Me Think**: Interfaces should be self-evident
- **Recognition > Recall**: Show options, don't require memory
- **Feedback**: Every action should have visible response
- **Error Prevention**: Better than good error messages
- **Consistency**: Similar things should work similarly
